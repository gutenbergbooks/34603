<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

  <p>The following pages have been written with a view to render some aid
  in establishing a sound and firm basis for future research, on that
  absorbing topic, the Causes and Nature of Epidemic Diseases.</p>

  <p>The amount of information already published on Fevers, on the
  Exanthemata, and on the Plague, is truly astonishing, and the more so
  when it is considered, that at present no rational account or explanation
  is given of the causes of these affections.</p>

  <p>It appears to me but reasonable to suppose that as every thing on this
  earth has been created on a wise and unerring principle, Epidemic and
  Infectious Diseases are only indicative of some serious errors in our
  social arrangements and habits. The dangers and misery brought upon us by
  disease, may, as shewn by Dr. Spurzheim and Mr. Combe, be warnings
  against the infringement of the natural laws.</p>

  <p>Indeed, what is more rational than to suppose that the Seeds of
  Disease are coeval with the fall of man. His first disobedience <!-- Page
  vi --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevi"></a>{vi}</span>brought
  death:&mdash;that his subsequent errors should hasten its approaches is
  not to be marvelled at. The undetected murderer, though he may escape the
  punishment human justice would inflict upon him for his delinquency,
  suffers a penalty in the tortures of conscience, infinitely more
  horrifying than the most ignominious death. The law of nature is
  triumphant.</p>

  <p>No less certain, though after a different manner, are the consequences
  of minor forms of disobedience. It is so ordained, that certain diseases
  shall arise, under peculiar conditions, which may have been brought about
  by a train of causes, easily imagined, and difficult to be explained, but
  all having their origin in the vices and errors of man in his moral and
  social relations.</p>

  <p>If man neglects the cultivation of the ground; with rank vegetation,
  the germs of fever will invisibly grow and multiply; if he harbours that
  which is rotten and corrupt, he is himself consumed by those agents
  destined to remove the rottenness and corruption; it is a part of the law
  of nature that there should be active and energetic agents for this
  purpose. The seeds of disease, like the seeds of plants, may be shewn to
  have <!-- Page vii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagevii"></a>{vii}</span>their indigenous localities; like them
  they may be spread and multiplied; like them they may lie dormant, and
  after awhile spring as it were into active existence; like them, when the
  soil and other conditions favour, they are ever ready to make their
  appearance. And this is the law, the germs of all disease exist, and have
  existed. Despise the dictates of nature, be careless of yourself and
  those around you, neglect to use the means which a noble intelligence has
  placed at your command, and above all, transgress the laws of God, then
  will disease pursue and attend you, as the conscience of the murderer
  pursues and attends him until he is finally cut off.</p>

  <p>His wants and necessities, his sufferings and privations, are the
  basis of the intellectual progress of man. The wonders of Omnipotence are
  revealed through the whirlwind, the storm, the pestilence, and the
  famine.</p>

  <p>The constructive and perceptive faculties of man have been developed
  by the necessity of protecting himself from injury by winds and rains;
  his intellectual faculties have been cultivated, by the sufferings of
  disease having led him to the study of <!-- Page viii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pageviii"></a>{viii}</span>organization and
  life, to discover the cause,&mdash;and to chemistry, and other sciences
  for the cure of his ailments.</p>

  <p>Famine and distress have aroused his emotions, and softened down his
  asperities, so that what appears at first to be the infliction of a Curse
  without Pity, is in reality a Judgment with Mercy.</p>

  <p>It occurred to me, that on the formation of the Epidemiological
  Society, the first question for consideration should be, What is the
  nature of those agents, which induce Epidemic Diseases? are they composed
  of animate or inanimate matter? In other words, do the manifestations of
  these diseases exhibit the operations of living or of chemical
  forces.</p>

  <p>Having, in my study, dwelt on the subject with an earnest desire to
  find the truth, I put the suggestion, with my ideas, before the public to
  reject or receive them. If they be rejected, I can but think a full
  discussion of the enquiry will lead to the most important results. If
  they be received with favour, I doubt not others, with more ability, will
  take up the strain and resolve the discords into harmony.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

  <p>It is one thing for a man to convince himself, but a very different
  thing to be able to convince others.</p>

  <p>I am not now speaking of a conviction arising from the impression made
  by a few startling facts, nor of one forced on the mind by early
  prejudices, or by the dogmas of the schools, but of a conviction arising
  from careful enquiry.</p>

  <p>In the course of that enquiry, the collector of facts, sees their
  relations to the idea in his mind, in a multiplicity of ways, from their
  remaining, each, as one succeeds the other, an appreciable time on the
  sensorium, and undergoing a certain process of comparison and relation,
  with all other facts and ideas which have been previously stored up. As
  the materials for an edifice which have been shaped and prepared in
  accordance with the completion of the design, so do the facts and ideas
  which are accumulated <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page2"></a>{2}</span>in the mind, become shaped and prepared for
  the elimination of a truth. The ultimate design of the architect can no
  more be conceived by the examination of the framework of a window, or the
  capital of a column, than the whole truth of a proposition by the
  examination of separate facts; the whole must be conceived and all the
  relations of all the parts thoroughly understood, before the architect
  can be comprehended or the harmony of his design appreciated.</p>

  <p>The process of thought in the minds of the architect, and in the
  framer of a proposition, is never exactly the same as in those who
  contemplate and examine their completed works. Much may be done, however,
  by both to aid others in comprehending them. The more accurately they
  keep in view the course their minds have taken, the more readily will
  their descriptions be understood.</p>

  <p>To simplify the elements of our knowledge is to give others a ready
  access to our thoughts.</p>

  <p>To arrange the course of our ideas in harmony with the elements of our
  knowledge should be the end of all writing, as it is the only means of
  multiplying knowledge. <!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page3"></a>{3}</span></p>

  <p>It is not the mere accumulation of facts which constitutes science,
  any more than a collection of building materials constitutes a house, it
  is the arrangement and adaptation of the means to the end by which the
  house becomes built and science cultivated.</p>

  <p>These reflections have been suggested by the circumstance that for the
  last 3000 years and upwards, Pestilences have at certain intervals done
  their work of destruction, and opened the springs of misery to untold
  millions, and yet I see not that we are much further advanced as to the
  knowledge of the cause of these inflictions than the Jews in the time of
  Moses. In the Levitical law, as I shall have occasion more particularly
  to shew hereafter, were directions specially given in reference to the
  plague of leprosy; what means should be adopted for the cure of the
  disease, and for preventing its extension, and moreover pointing very
  significantly to certain facts having connexion with the cause of the
  affection. Since that time historians generally, and medical writers in
  particular, have diligently recorded their observations and accumulated
  facts, on the various desolating plagues which <!-- Page 4 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>{4}</span>have afflicted mankind.
  Some of these men have grappled with the whole subject, and endeavoured
  to shew the presumed relation of the supposed causes in all their
  intricacies, but it is hardly necessary to say that all have signally
  failed in their attempts to furnish us with any practical
  information.</p>

  <p>Satisfied in my own mind that the whole subject is beyond the labour
  of one man, and impressed with the belief that the basis of the enquiry
  is in anything but a satisfactory state, I have applied myself entirely
  to the study of the groundwork only, as the primary proceeding for a
  solid superstructure.</p>

  <p>The days are past, when imaginary spirits, ethers, and astronomical
  phenomena, were believed to have any essential influence over our
  destinies in a physical point of view; we have therefore to deal with
  <i>matter</i> in some form or other.</p>

  <p>The question, therefore, which I have proposed for enquiry, is,
  whether the matter which causes epidemic and endemic diseases, exhibits
  the properties of inorganic or organized matter.</p>

  <p>The properties and qualities of organized <!-- Page 5 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page5"></a>{5}</span>bodies, as well as those of
  inorganic matter, need but be stated, and in some instances we may
  picture to ourselves the object, without having seen it, and not be very
  far from a true conception. But for this purpose a clear and definite
  idea must be previously formed, and have taken possession of the mind, of
  the great general divisions of objects in the material world.</p>

  <p>Having made these preliminary remarks, I have suggested a certain mode
  of procedure in making enquiries of this kind, not perhaps in strict
  accordance with logical systems, but on the principle of nature's
  operations in our own minds, which appears to me, when reduced to a
  systematic and simple form, to be sufficiently clear and strict for
  synthetical application, and so concise as to be usefully and practicably
  applied.</p>

  <p>In endeavouring to establish a theory for the explanation of
  extraordinary phenomena, there are certain rules which should guide us in
  the thorny and treacherous path of speculation. But these rules readily
  flow from the train of thought, and if we examine our own minds during
  their operations, we <!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page6"></a>{6}</span>shall find that the following is the course of
  our instinctive reflections. It is a course we adopt as the test of
  theories when formed, and is a guide in all cases for their
  construction.</p>

  <p>We first commence with an idea, which exists in our minds in the form
  of a proposition: then the following rules naturally suggest
  themselves:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. The probability of the value of our proposition from inference.</p>

  <p>2. The number and value of facts to support the proposition.</p>

  <p>3. The reasonableness of the application of the facts to the
  inference.</p>

  <p>4. What amount of information in the form of results can be produced
  in proof of the tenableness of the proposition.<a name="NtA1"
  href="#Nt1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In illustration of the value of these rules the history of Dr.
  Jenner's discovery affords an appropriate example. To use the words of
  Dr. Gregory, "he appears very early in <!-- Page 7 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>{7}</span>life to have had his
  attention fixed by a popular notion among the peasantry of
  Gloucestershire, of the existence of an affection in the cow, supposed to
  afford security against the Small Pox; but he was not successful in
  convincing his professional brethren of the importance of the
  <i>idea</i>."</p>

  <p>The popular notion of the peasantry originated the idea in Jenner's
  mind, and it became fixed there as a proposition.</p>

  <p>1. He commenced his enquiry by observing that the hands of milkers on
  the dairy farms were subject to an eruption, and he <i>inferred</i> that
  the notion of the peasantry bore the stamp of probability, which
  strengthened the idea in his mind and gave force to the proposition.</p>

  <p>2. His next step was to accumulate facts; he found on enquiry that the
  persons engaged on these farms in milking, possessed an immunity from
  Small Pox to an extent sufficient to strengthen the value of his
  proposition.</p>

  <p>3. The reasonableness of the application of the facts to the inference
  is clear from the coincidence that the eruption on the hands of the dairy
  people bore a striking <!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page8"></a>{8}</span>resemblance to the Small Pox, and as this
  disease does not usually occur twice in the same individual, the
  inference was most reasonable that this eruption protected the people
  from Small Pox.</p>

  <p>4. We have but to take the almost universal adoption of vaccination,
  and its acknowledged prophylactic powers against the propagation of Small
  Pox to shew the application of our fourth rule.<a name="NtA2"
  href="#Nt2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Between the conception of the idea and the accomplishment of Jenner's
  designs, vaccination seems to have undergone an incubation of nearly
  twenty years. During that period, with an energy and perseverance only to
  be obtained by confidence, did this great man brood over and elaborate
  his idea; and well might the 14th day of May, <!-- Page 9 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>{9}</span>1796, be styled the birth
  day of vaccination, for on that day was a child first inoculated from the
  hands of a milker.</p>

  <p>In adopting the above method I have endeavoured to bear in mind M.
  Quetelet's observations on the requirements necessary for medical
  authorship; he says, "All reasonable men will, I think, agree on this
  point, that we must inform ourselves by observation, collect
  well-recorded facts, render them rigorously comparable, before seeking to
  discuss them with a view of declaring their relations, and methodically
  proceeding to the appreciation of causes."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">IS IT PROBABLE THAT EPIDEMIC, ENDEMIC, AND
INFECTIOUS DISEASES, DEPEND UPON VITAL
GERMS FOR THEIR MANIFESTATIONS?</p>

  <p>It is, I believe, almost universally considered that Epidemic,
  Endemic, and Infectious diseases, originate from some imaginary poisons
  of a specific nature, each disease having its own peculiar poison. That
  this conception should have taken possession of the minds of men, is most
  natural from the symptoms which characterize these diseases, but when we
  come to enquire into the nature of these agents, or supposed poisons, we
  are at once struck with the idea that they exhibit one peculiarity which
  separates them in a marked manner, from those poisons with which we are
  familiar; for the poisons of Small Pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Hooping
  Cough, Fever, &amp;c. possess the power of multiplication, or spontaneous
  increase, a property which attaches only to the organic kingdom, and is
  never known in the inorganic kingdom. The source of most of the poisons
  is to be found among mineral or vegetable products. A mineral in
  combination with an acid or oxygen may become a poison, and <!-- Page 12
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>{12}</span>nitrogen in
  various combinations with oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon, or with carbon
  alone, may become a poison; these combinations are, however, in most
  instances the products of vegetable life, others again are obtained from
  the animal kingdom, such as the poison of the serpent, &amp;c. but in all
  of these instances, there is not one in which the power of
  self-multiplication is to be found.</p>

  <p>We are, therefore, constrained to admit that this feature, which
  distinguishes poisons, is one well worthy attentive consideration. The
  varieties of poisons may be classified into those which act topically as
  escharotic poisons, those which act chemically on the blood, and those
  whose effects are manifested in inducing a speedy annihilation of organic
  or vital action, as in the case of hydrocyanic acid, which is supposed
  specifically to affect the nervous centres from which originate the vital
  manifestations. It is rather remarkable that the vital poisons (as I will
  call them for distinction), seem to have their appropriate locality in
  the blood, they do not primarily affect one organ more than another, all
  the effects we witness resulting from them are to be traced progressively
  from the blood to other parts of the body. When a person is inoculated
  with small pox, a very minute portion (indeed it is impossible to say how
  minute it may be) is sufficient, when absorbed, to excite a certain train
  of symptoms, all due to absorption of the materies of the disease, and
  the process by which <!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page13"></a>{13}</span>that materies arrives at maturity, is that
  known in the vegetable world as the fructification; this process of
  fructification is a process of development and increase.</p>

  <p>I here may repeat that among all the poisons known, constituted as
  they are of various combinations of elementary matter, they are without
  exception destitute of the power of development or increase. Now, it is
  pretty accurately known what amount of these poisons is necessary to
  produce their effects on the living body; we can say how many drops are
  sufficient of hydrocyanic acid of Scheeles strength, to destroy a man
  instantaneously. Again, how many grains of arsenious acid are sufficient
  to induce such an inflammatory condition of the stomach and intestine as
  will end in death, and how many grains of morphia, will bring about a
  fatal coma,&mdash;but who shall say the amount of the vital poisons
  necessary to produce their results? It far exceeds the limit of
  conjecture, to what extent the dilution of miasmatic or contagious matter
  may be carried, and the poison yet be capable of committing in a short
  time the most frightful ravages.</p>

  <p>We may fairly then infer, that if a quantity of matter inappreciable
  in amount be sufficient to exhibit the characters of growth and increase,
  that it is endowed with the properties of vitality. That the poisons of
  scarlet fever, of measles, and of small-pox have this power of growth and
  increase, is as much a matter of universal belief as that "the sun <!--
  Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>{14}</span>will
  rise and set to-morrow, and that all living beings will die."</p>

  <p>This power of individual increase, or reproduction, is the very summit
  of vital manifestation; indeed Coleridge, in his Theory of Life, (in
  which he says, "I define life as the <i>principle of individuation</i>,
  or the power which unites a given <i>all</i> into a whole that is
  presupposed by all its parts,") places reproduction in the first rank,
  and expresses his hypothesis thus: "the constituent forces of life in the
  human living body are, first, the power of length or reproduction; 2nd,
  the power of surface, or irritability; 3rd, the power of depth, or
  sensibility&mdash;life itself is neither of these separately, but the
  copula of all three."</p>

  <p>Extensive research is not required to shew that many thinking men
  believe in the existence of living organic beings, as the elements of
  contagious and epidemic diseases; the idea indeed seems to flow
  spontaneously in that direction. Whenever thought, and enduring
  contemplation, have been concentrated on the subject, the result appears
  to have been the same, a firm conviction in each individual mind that a
  vital force must be in operation; or as Schlegel would define it, "a
  living reproductive power, capable of and designed to develope and
  propagate itself."&mdash;"Its Maker originally fixed and assigned to it
  the end towards which all its efforts were ultimately to be
  directed."</p>

  <p>Referring further to beings having the property of reproduction and
  propagation, he says, (using <!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page15"></a>{15}</span>the word nature here evidently as the vital
  principle for want of a better term,) "Nature indeed is not free like
  man, but still is not a piece of dead clockwork. <i>There is life in
  it.</i>"&mdash;"Thus we know that even plants sleep, and that they too as
  much as animals, though after a different sort, have a true impregnation
  and propagation."</p>

  <p>When Schlegel wrote this, how little could he have imagined the
  intricacy of this proceeding among the lower forms of vegetation. It has
  been shewn by Suminski, and verified by many others, that the mode of
  impregnation, and the period at which it occurs in the ferns, do not at
  all correspond to the general notion on this subject. He has discovered
  in the early development of the frond of ferns certain cells, which he
  denominates antheridia, or sperm cells; these contain in their cavity a
  number of subordinate cells, each containing a spermatazoon. At a certain
  period of the progress of the frond, the parent cells become ruptured and
  liberate the spermatoza, these move about in a mucilaginous fluid, which
  bedews the inferior surface of the frond, and become the means of
  impregnating the germ cells, or pistillidia, with which they readily come
  in contact. Thus the process of impregnation in these plants occurs
  during the germination, or what corresponds to the period of germination
  in the seeds of exogenous and endogenous plants.</p>

  <p>I have referred to the discovery of Suminski in <!-- Page 16 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page16"></a>{16}</span>this place to recal to
  the mind the great and incomprehensible wonders of creation, for who
  could conceive it possible or feasible that even for the impregnation of
  an inferior vegetable, animal life should form an indispensable and
  essential appurtenant of the process. Truly may we say with Coleridge, of
  plants and insects, "so reciprocally inter-dependent and necessary are
  they to each other, that we can almost as little think of vegetation
  without insects, as of insects without vegetation."</p>

  <p>I will make but two more quotations on the supposed vital character of
  the germs of disease. "That the air and atmosphere of our globe is in the
  highest degree full of life, I may, I think, take here for granted, and
  generally admitted. It is, however, of a mixed kind and quality,
  combining the refreshing breath of spring with the parching simooms of
  the desert, and where the healthy odours fluctuate in chaotic struggle
  with the most deadly vapours. What else in general <i>is the wide-spread
  and spreading pestilence</i>, but a living propagation of foulness,
  corruption, and death? Are not many poisons, <i>especially animal
  poisons, in a true sense, living forces</i>?"&mdash;Schlegel.<a
  name="NtA3" href="#Nt3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It were useless to multiply quotations to shew <!-- Page 17 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page17"></a>{17}</span>that the opinions here
  entertained are matters of general belief among thinking men.<a
  name="NtA4" href="#Nt4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> I will at once then conclude
  with an observation of Dr. C. J. B. Williams: he puts the question, "Does
  the matter of contagion consist of vegetable seeds? Are infectious
  diseases the results of the operations and invasions of living parasites,
  disturbing in sundry ways the structures and functions of the body, each
  after its own kind, until the vital powers either fail or succeed in
  expelling the invading tribes from the system?"</p>

  <p>And this expression, the seeds, is an universal expression, it is a
  "Household Word" in connexion with disease. That it has obtained this
  position in the popular vocabulary is alone a proof of the applicability
  of the term to the thing intended to be <!-- Page 18 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page18"></a>{18}</span>signified. Popular
  notions, as we have seen in the case of Jenner's discovery, are not to be
  unheeded. An instance occurs to me, it was a popular belief, that in acne
  punctata, the matter of a sebaceous follicle, was itself, when pressed
  out, a worm, the dark portion which results from the accumulation of dust
  upon the matter at the mouth of the follicle was supposed to be the head
  of the maggot, as it was called; subsequent observation, however, has
  proved that though this matter is not a worm, it contains an animal
  within its substance, the Acarus folliculorum.</p>

  <p>The popular notions found among savage tribes as to the efficacy of
  certain remedies in the cure of disease have been the means of furnishing
  us with some of our most valuable medicines, indeed it is almost
  impossible to say whether originally man did not derive his remedies from
  the herbs and trees by an instinctive faculty impelling him, as it does
  the animals when in a state of liberty and with freedom of range, to seek
  certain plants as they avoid others.</p>

  <p>It is well known that animals when indisposed will find out some spot
  as if almost led to it by a visionary guide where the "healing plant" is
  to be discovered. I am told that sheep have this faculty, and that they
  will, when affected with the rot, feed upon some plant when they can
  discover it, which eradicates the disease.</p>

  <p>Almost every one is familiar with the fact that cats and dogs will
  crop herbage and eat it; I have <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page19"></a>{19}</span>seen them frequently leave the house and
  proceed to the grass in the most business-like manner, partake of some
  quantity, and quietly return.</p>

  <p>A close observer of diseased animals might obtain some useful
  information by noticing the plants cropped by them while in that
  condition. The observations should be made in a variety of districts in
  consequence of the uncertain distribution of some even of the most
  commonly scattered plants; in one year they may be abundant, but in
  another they may be almost entirely absent from the same spot.<a
  name="NtA5" href="#Nt5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Were it only on the fact of reproduction, I would be contented to take
  my stand that the force of life is the indwelling power of pestilential
  matter. Reproduction is a law of nature, and the law of nature is the law
  of God. And where do we find He prevaricates with us? The more we study
  His laws the more harmony and perfection we find; what is seeming
  confusion in the ignorance of to-day, is order in the knowledge of
  to-morrow. If any one ignorant of the law which regulates the diffusion
  of gases were <!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page20"></a>{20}</span>told that a heavier gas would ascend
  contrary to its specific gravity through the septum in a vessel
  containing a lighter gas above the heavier, he would naturally doubt your
  assertion, and say, "that is contrary to the law of gravity;" but explain
  to him the principle by which this comes about, and the objects of the
  law; the order and beauty of the design become manifest. But this is no
  equivocation, it is evidence there, that subordinate laws exist and
  nothing more. It has never been found that men have gathered "grapes of
  thorns and figs of thistles," nor has it ever been discovered that
  inanimate matter multiplies itself. The seed of disease "is within
  itself," multiplying and propagating itself; whether it formed a part of
  creation at the beginning or not, is rather a question to be solved by
  divines than physicians. When we know, however, the latency of seeds and
  even of entire plants, and that they may be dried and remain so for years
  yet being brought again into conditions adapted to their active
  existence, they, as it were, revive from their sleep, and renew again
  their reproductive properties: can we wonder if, in the great scheme of
  nature, existences new to mankind should make their appearance? When the
  New Zealander saw the surface of his ground producing to him unknown
  plants, and the skins of his children generating peculiar eruptions, and
  each propagating its kind, would he look, think you, to the wood or the
  stones, the air or the water,&mdash;for the solution of the <!-- Page 21
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"></a>{21}</span>mystery? No, he
  would naturally say these people brought the <i>seeds</i> with them. From
  the property of reproduction possessed by these forms of matter, we infer
  the value of the proposition.</p>

<hr class="full" />

<p><!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"></a>{22}</span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE NUMBER AND VALUE OF FACTS TO SUPPORT
THE PROPOSITION.</p>

<p class="cenhead">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="cenhead">SECTION I.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON REPRODUCTION.</span></p>

  <p>It is inferred that the proposition, "<i>the matter which operates in
  the production of Epidemic, Endemic, and Infectious Diseases, possesses
  the property of vitality</i>," we proceed now to the enumeration of those
  facts which further elucidate this subject.</p>

  <p>The facts must necessarily be such as illustrate the identity of
  properties in the imaginary germs, that are known to exist in
  demonstrable germs: we take therefore the law of reproduction to be to
  life, what the law of attraction is to gravitation.<a name="NtA6"
  href="#Nt6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>{23}</span></p>

  <p>But further; do those matters which engender disease furnish to our
  minds the properties inseparable from life in the abstract? Though the
  faculty of reproduction is essentially an evidence that the thing which
  reproduces its kind must be a living body, yet it is only a property or
  power of living beings and is not itself life, it therefore is necessary
  to establish the fact that the <i>materies morbi</i> not only has the
  power of reproduction, but also those properties which in the abstract
  will prove as far as demonstration can go, that it has the essential
  properties common to all living bodies.</p>

  <p>I must again quote from Coleridge, he says: "By life I every where
  mean the true idea of life, or that most general form under which life
  manifests itself to us, which includes all its other forms. This I have
  stated to be the <i>tendency to individuation</i> and the degrees or
  intensities of life, to consist in the progressive realization of this
  tendency. The <!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page24"></a>{24}</span>power which is acknowledged to exist
  wherever the realization is found, must subsist wherever the tendency is
  manifested. The power which comes forth and stirs abroad in the bird,
  must be latent in the egg."</p>

  <p>The tendency to individuation cannot be more strongly marked than in
  the simple experiment of vaccination: we insert a small particle of the
  so-called vaccine lymph under the skin, and by this means we multiply to
  an enormous extent, the power which, in the first instance, we had in the
  form of minute corpuscles in a dry and apparently inert state;
  nevertheless, though in this condition there must have existed the
  tendency to individuation or multiplication of individual existence, and
  the germs are here to their active existence, as seen in the development
  of the vaccine vesicle, what the egg is to the bird,<a name="NtA7"
  href="#Nt7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> as described above; we may, therefore, say
  that the power which exhibits itself in the production of a vaccine
  vesicle, must have been latent in the dried matter. It is the opinion of
  Muller that the entire vital principle of the egg <!-- Page 25 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>{25}</span>resides in the germinal
  disk alone, and since <i>the external influences which act on the
  germs</i> of the most different organic beings are the same, we must
  regard the simple germinal disk, consisting of granular amorphous matter,
  as the potential whole of the future animal, endowed with the essential
  and specific force or principle of the future being, and capable of
  increasing the very small amount of this specific force and matter, which
  it already possesses, by the assimilation of new matter.</p>

  <p>After speaking of inanimate objects, Dr. Carpenter says; "and what
  compared with the permanence of these is the duration of any structure
  subject to the conditions of <i>vitality</i>? <i>To be born</i>, to grow,
  to arrive at maturity, to decline, to die, to decay, is the sum of the
  history of every being that lives; from man, in the pomp of royalty, or
  the pride of philosophy, to the gay and thoughtless insect that glitters
  for a few hours in the sunbeam and is seen no more; from the stately oak,
  the monarch of the forest through successive centuries, to the humble
  fungus which shoots forth and withers in a day."</p>

  <p>To be born, signifies the faculty of reproduction existing or having
  existed in an antecedent being to that one born, and also that itself
  possesses equally a like power. To be born, is the first expression which
  must be used in speaking of the faculties or properties of living beings
  as independent existences, the annual formation of buds, trees, and
  shrubs, is a multiplication of the species; the coral <!-- Page 26
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"></a>{26}</span>and various
  budding polypes increase by this process, indeed what is the seed of a
  plant, or the egg of a bird, or the ovum of mammalia, but cast off buds;
  in all, the new being was originally a portion of its parent, and if we
  examine the ovary of the vegetable, the bird, or the mammal, can we find
  any expression more fitting to designate the process than that of
  budding. To be born then, is the evidence of an act of one living being,
  and the commencement of a series of vital phenomena in another, but all
  these are subsequent to reproduction, and constitute another chain of
  vital acts, all tending to a similar result, the multiplication of the
  species.<a name="NtA8" href="#Nt8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Now, whether we apply the philosophical language of Coleridge, or the
  language of observation of Muller, in confirmation of the doctrine here
  inculcated, we arrive at the same point.</p>

  <p>Do we not witness in the newly formed vaccine vesicle, an increase of
  the specific force and principle? We certainly have acquired by the
  process of vaccination a manifold multiplication of power, and is there
  not also assimilation of new matter in <!-- Page 27 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page27"></a>{27}</span>which this power resides?
  And does not every particle of this new matter contain within itself the
  same force and principle, as existed in that which generated it?</p>

  <p>"We revert again to potentiated length in the power of magnetism
  (reproduction); to surface in the power of electricity, and to the
  synthesis of both or potentiated depth in constructive, that is chemical
  affinity."<a name="NtA9" href="#Nt9"><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Some may be at a loss to conceive, at first, how irritability may be
  considered a property of all vegetable matter; that it does exist in some
  vegetables is certain, but that it does exist in all living beings is
  equally certain;<a name="NtA10" href="#Nt10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> the
  term, however, which would appear more appropriate when that irritability
  does not exhibit itself in an appreciable form, is <i>impressibility</i>.
  Irritability, as commonly understood, is seen in its highest condition in
  muscular tissue; but "the irritable power and an analogon of voluntary
  motion first dawn on us in the vegetable world in the stamina and anthers
  at the period of <!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page28"></a>{28}</span>impregnation."&mdash;"The insect world is
  the exponent of irritability, as the vegetable is of reproduction."</p>

  <p>The property of irritability attains its acme in man, the most highly
  organized of all beings; and its gradations pass downwards through the
  whole scale of animate creation; not so reproduction, for this faculty
  observes the very opposite direction, for in plants a single impregnation
  is sufficient for the evolution of myriads of detached lives.</p>

  <p>Reproduction is a fact, it is an essential property of life, and is a
  reality to us from observation; but irritability is not so tangible and
  demonstrable a property. We nevertheless may assume its universality,
  from the circumstance that we lose sight of it by imperceptible degrees;
  the irritability of the sensitive plant is as much irritability as that
  of the highly organized muscle; but because the faculty evades our
  perception, "in tapering by degrees, becoming beautifully less," we have
  no reason for pronouncing its total extinction at any one point of the
  vegetable kingdom,<a name="NtA11" href="#Nt11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> any
  more than we should have <!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page29"></a>{29}</span>in saying that we see the end of the earth,
  when describing the extent of our vision as we stand on the sea shore.
  The extreme limit of our vision is the tangent of the circle in reference
  to our visual organs; but how many tangential points there may be beyond,
  it is impossible to say without knowing the dimensions of the circle.</p>

  <p>I think we are now in a condition to assume, as far as abstraction
  will conduct us without proceeding to an extreme length, that the
  <i>materies morbi</i>, or, as I will now call them for the sake of
  clearer distinction, <i>semina morbi</i>, possess those properties which
  in the abstract are common to all living beings.</p>

  <p>Another argument strikes me as capable of adding further strength to
  the proposition. We need but be told that a small piece of iron was
  placed in a certain position with regard to another piece of iron, and
  that the smaller piece moved through a given space and became attached to
  the larger, to infer that magnetic force was in operation. Supposing this
  magnet then to be folded in paper, and that it <!-- Page 30 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>{30}</span>be promiscuously placed
  near a compass, the deflection of the needle would indicate that some
  object in the vicinity was the cause of the deflection; we may farther
  try what positions the needle takes by varying the position of the
  packet, and thus point out which is the north and which the south pole of
  the screw of paper. If we may consider attraction then to be to
  gravitation what reproduction is to life, we do not err in saying in the
  one instance that there is a living being, and in the other there is a
  magnet.</p>

  <p>The nebular theory, from which some astronomers made the foundation of
  many speculations, came with so much interest to our minds that the
  fascination could not be resisted. It was most delightful to revel in the
  imagination that we possessed a key to the mode of formation of the
  starry hosts, and when speculation had taken its extreme limits in the
  "Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation," and the nebulæ had served
  as the ground work of a gigantic scheme, Lord Ross's monster telescope
  swept the heavens of its cobwebs. We can imagine this great promoter of
  science saying to us, Gentlemen, the clouds which have obscured you, are
  composed of myriads of stars, and comprise systems as vast and as
  luminous as our own, had you but power of vision to discern them. A new
  light thus appeared to philosophers, and though no great practical
  results may flow from the discovery, it is instructive from the fact that
  the imperfectly aided or unaided vision, should not limit legitimate <!--
  Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page31"></a>{31}</span>inference. The nebulæ before Lord Ross's
  discovery were to the astronomer what the materies of epidemic and
  infectious disease are to medical men. In the absence however of a giant
  microscope to reveal such great truths, we may yet dimly shadow them by
  the light of our reason. It was predicted in 1849 that minute vegetable
  germs, in all probability all of the same type, were the agents producing
  epidemic and infectious disease. In 1850, Mr. Oke Spooner says,<a
  name="NtA12" href="#Nt12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> "On examining the matter of
  Small <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page32"></a>{32}</span>Pox and Cow Pox in every stage, he finds its
  essential character to consist of a number of minute cells not exceeding
  the 10,000th part of an inch in diameter: being about one-fourth smaller
  than the globules of the blood, containing within their circumference
  many still more minute nuclei, and presenting beyond their circumference
  bud-like cells of the same size and character as those contained within
  the circle."</p>

  <p>Should these observations made by Mr. Spooner turn out to be correct,
  they will but fulfil my anticipations. Then again shall we see the same
  application of imperfect vision to the limitation or temporary
  obstruction of solid and determinate knowledge.</p>

  <p>We may reasonably expect that these bodies, discovered by Mr. Spooner,
  should be the elementary matters of disease. Their existence was
  predicted from the probability that living matter must be the agent;
  moreover, that this matter when discovered <!-- Page 33 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>{33}</span>would be cellular, most
  probably resembling the yeast plant as described by Mr. Spooner.</p>

  <p>It was predicted that a planet would be discovered in a certain
  position in the heavens, because the perturbations of a comet indicated
  an attracting body in the path of the eccentric wanderer; the prediction
  and the fulfilment were almost simultaneous.</p>

<p class="cenhead">SECTION II.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">HISTORICAL NOTICE OF EPIDEMIC DISEASES.</span></p>

  <p>The earliest notices we have of Pestilences are contained in Holy
  Writ. The plagues which smote the Egyptians in the time of Moses are not
  unworthy some comment here. Of those ten plagues, four out of the number
  were due to the miraculous appearance of myriads of the lower animal
  tribes, in three instances of insects,<a name="NtA13"
  href="#Nt13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> viz. lice, flies, and locusts; in the
  fourth, when Aaron stretched forth his hand with his rod over the
  streams, over the rivers, and the ponds, frogs came up and covered the
  land of Egypt. In these instances living beings are made the instruments
  in God's hand for the punishment of the wicked. These plagues include the
  second, third, fourth, and eighth. The first plague is mentioned as a
  conversion of the waters into blood. Now if we may take this expression
  as being literal, there is no reason to suppose that this blood differed
  in any respect from ordinary sanguineous liquid; we therefore may assume,
  as the blood is every where in Scripture spoken of as the <i>life</i>,
  that this fluid was endowed with vital properties.</p>

<p><!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>{35}</span></p>

  <p>The fifth plague is described as a murrain among beasts; and the
  sixth, as exhibiting itself as "a boil breaking forth with blains, upon
  man and upon beast."<a name="NtA14" href="#Nt14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Now
  these affections bear a resemblance to the diseases known to us at the
  present day through authentic records. The Black Death of the 14th
  century affords in its history but too awful a picture of the horrors of
  such pestilences. In the tenth plague, the smiting of the first-born, we
  are not told by what means it was brought about; but we have something
  even here to lead us to conjecture. In the second visitation of the Black
  Death, there were destroyed a great many children whom it had formerly
  spared, and but few women. The seventh plague of hail is within our
  conception; as is also that of darkness, the ninth plague.</p>

  <p>It is not a little remarkable that of the ten plagues, seven of them
  depended upon agents intelligible to our comprehension; we can conceive
  of <!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page36"></a>{36}</span>the invasion of a country by myriads of
  loathsome insects and reptiles, and can imagine the wrath of an offended
  Deity directing the force of a supernatural storm of hail upon a
  disobedient people; and we can conjecture, though faintly, the
  consternation of human nature on being subjected to a total darkness of
  three days' duration, when we consider <i>that</i> darkness has been
  described, as "a darkness that might be felt."</p>

  <p>From this abstract we discover that the three plagues whose causes we
  cannot understand, or rather upon which no light has been thrown by
  Scripture, bear analogies to those which we recognise, in the writings of
  modern authors, as fearful pestilences.</p>

  <p>It is now our province to reflect on the causes supposed to be in
  operation in the three instances, which become naturally separated from
  the rest.</p>

  <p>We are told that a murrain appeared among the cattle, without any
  preliminary step. When the blains broke out upon man and beast, Moses had
  been previously directed by the Almighty to take handfuls of the ashes of
  the furnace, and sprinkle them towards the heaven in the sight of
  Pharaoh. "<i>And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt</i>,
  and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast,
  throughout all the land of Egypt."</p>

  <p>Another coincidence, in connexion with subsequent pestilences, arrests
  the attention, on the subject of the mysterious appearance on these
  occasions of <!-- Page 37 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page37"></a>{37}</span>matter resembling dust being prevalent about
  the houses, and on the clothes of the people. Clouds also, and showers of
  dust-like particles, were not of infrequent occurrence. Indeed, in the
  summer of 1849, during the progress of the Cholera, several phenomena of
  a similar nature were observed and authenticated; I myself can bear
  testimony to one instance of the kind. It was observed by many persons in
  my neighbourhood after the passage of an ominous and lurid cloud, that as
  they walked their clothes became covered with a singular dust-like matter
  of very peculiar appearance. That this phenomenon was not destitute of
  significance may be gathered from the fact, that on the night of that day
  several severe cases of Cholera occurred, though our village had been
  comparatively free for ten days.</p>

  <p>Hecker, in writing on the Black Death says, the German accounts
  expressly speak of a "thick stinking mist which advanced from the east,<a
  name="NtA15" href="#Nt15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> and <!-- Page 38 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>{38}</span>spread itself over Italy;
  there could be no deception in so palpable a phenomenon." It is not
  unworthy of mention, that in the East successive invasions of locusts
  "which had never perhaps darkened the sun in thicker swarms," preceded
  the great outbreak of this disease, for they left famine in their
  train.</p>

  <p>From 1500 to 1503 in Germany and France, during the prevalence of the
  sweating sickness, spots of different colours made their appearance,
  "principally red, but also white, yellow, grey, and black, often in a
  very short time, on the roofs of houses, on clothes, on the veils and
  neckerchiefs of women, &amp;c." Blood rain is also mentioned as having
  occurred at this time, which consisted of the aggregation of minute
  particles of red matter.</p>

  <p>In the seven plagues, miraculous operations of the Deity consisted in
  the unusual manifestation of phenomena, but which in their effects are
  recognizable as of clear and definite import. The miracles here
  are,&mdash;in the <i>mode</i> of producing the swarms of frogs, locusts,
  &amp;c. but they are manifest and unmistakeable <i>causes</i> of plague
  and famine; in the other three, on the contrary, we witness only the
  effects, the causes are hidden from us; we may, therefore, as in current
  events, legitimately investigate the subject, and what better course can
  be adopted than that which classifies the traditionary past with all
  subsequent history. Presuming such a method of research to be admitted, I
  have assumed that as <!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page39"></a>{39}</span>the <i>causes</i> of the seven plagues have
  been distinctly given, the others, though only mentioned in their
  effects, were due to causes of a nature in some way to be compared with
  their concomitants, that is to say, if a special intervention of the
  Deity brought about a miraculous appearance of frogs, lice, &amp;c. there
  is but little reason to doubt that some other agent was miraculously
  multiplied and concentrated to induce the murrain, engender the blain,
  and smite the first-born: as if to lead us into this enquiry, on the
  visitation of the blain in man and beast, the Bible History tells us that
  Moses threw ashes of the furnace, which became a dust throughout all the
  land of Egypt; we cannot imagine that this simply as ashes could have
  caused the blain, we may conclude that by some special miracle, either
  the ashes were converted into a specific form of matter capable of
  inducing the effects recorded, or that an independent septic matter was
  generated for the purpose. If the latter, the act of throwing the ashes
  of the furnace into the air may have been intended to signify that the
  extremely minute division of the particles when thus cast into space,
  typified the inscrutable and hidden nature of the matter endowed with
  such marvellous properties.<a name="NtA16"
  href="#Nt16"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>{40}</span></p>

  <p>Further on in the book of Leviticus are passages which I cannot
  forbear transcribing, for they point out to us most indubitably a line of
  enquiry in reference to diseases of a contagious nature.</p>

  <p>"The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a
  woollen garment, or a linen garment, whether it be in the warp or woof,
  of linen or of woollen, whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin,
  and if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment ... it is a
  plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the Priest, and the Priest
  shall look upon the plague and shut up it that hath the plague seven
  days; and he shall look on the plague on the seventh day; if the plague
  be spread in the garment, either in the warp, &amp;c. ... the plague is a
  fretting leprosy, it is unclean. He shall therefore burn that garment ...
  wherein the plague is, for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in
  the fire. And if the Priest shall look, and behold, the plague be not
  spread in the garment ... then the Priest shall command that they wash
  the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:
  and the Priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and
  behold if the plague have <i>not</i> changed his colour, and the plague
  be not spread, it is unclean; thou <!-- Page 41 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page41"></a>{41}</span>shalt burn it in the
  fire; it is fret inward; whether it be bare within or without. And if the
  Priest look and behold the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of
  it, then he shall rend it out of the garment ... and if it appear still
  in the garment either in the warp or the woof ... it is a spreading
  plague: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire. And the
  garment ... which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them,
  then it shall be washed the second time and shall be clean."&mdash;Chap.
  xiii. 47-58.</p>

  <p>Again in Deuteronomy. The curse for disobedience: "The Lord shall make
  the pestilence cleave to thee until he have consumed thee from off the
  land.&mdash;The Lord shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a
  fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with
  the drought, and with blasting, and with <i>mildew</i>, and they shall
  pursue thee until thou perish.&mdash;The Lord shall make the rain of thy
  land <i>powder</i> and <i>dust</i>: from heaven shall it come down upon
  thee until thou be destroyed."</p>

  <p>It may be said, and I doubt not will be said, all this is
  unnecessarily dragging the sacred volume into an enquiry totally foreign
  to its general tenor; on the contrary, however, I maintain by that Book
  we are to learn the ways of God to man, and further, that no study can
  impress mankind with so awful, so terrific an idea of his responsible
  position, as that which leads him into the investigation of the causes
  <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>{42}</span>by
  which the Almighty, doubtless in His wisdom, has thought fit at various
  epochs of this world's history, to place man face to face with
  pestilence, famine and sudden death.</p>

  <p>There is no man would less willingly than myself introduce profanely
  the revelations of Scripture. The observations here made are not,
  therefore, intended for light or heedless controversy; if they have a
  significance of any import, let them be alluded to in the same spirit
  with which they have been quoted; if they convey nothing for approval to
  the reader, let silence rest upon them. To those who would fain disregard
  my request, let me recall to their minds the veneration which from
  childhood I trust we have always felt on hearing or seeing those two
  words&mdash;Holy Bible.</p>

  <p>It is yet to be determined, whether the greenish or reddish appearance
  of the garment spoken of, as being contaminated with the plague of the
  leprosy had any specific relation to the disease itself. The priest
  orders that the garment shall be shut up seven days, and on the seventh
  day, if the plague be increased, by which, of course, is meant if the
  greenish or reddish colour have increased, and from which we may gather
  that a power of spontaneous increase was possessed by the matter, such a
  result indicated a fretting leprosy, and the garment was to be burnt.
  Again, though there may have been no increase, but a persistence of the
  coloured matter after shutting up and washing the garment, it is to <!--
  Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>{43}</span>be
  burnt, for it is fret inward, signifying, that the germs of the affection
  are still there, and may soon increase. Other rules follow in reference
  to the plague of leprosy, and the mode of deciding whether an article be
  unclean or clean is definitely laid down, but our purpose is served in
  mentioning the above, to shew that in the time of Moses the spontaneous
  increase of certain minute multiplying germs was supposed to have a close
  connexion with disease. It is equally clear, that the priests were aware
  by the order given them, that if the ordinary modes of purifying articles
  of clothing failed in their effect, the safest and surest method of
  destroying infectious matter was to resort to the practice of consuming
  by fire all materials capable of propagating an infectious malady.</p>

  <p>The facts above noticed, accurately correspond to what we now know as
  applicable to the matter of infectious and contagious maladies. It is a
  rule, I believe universally adopted throughout the Poor-houses of this
  country, to put the clothes of all persons about to become residents in
  these establishments, into ovens, where they are submitted to a
  temperature incompatible with the existence of either animal or vegetable
  life. By this means all living matters are destroyed, but the fabrics and
  inorganic matters retain their properties intact. This simple proceeding,
  I am credibly informed, is an effectual preventive of contamination by
  articles of clothing, a desideratum of no small importance, when it is
  <!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page44"></a>{44}</span>remembered that the diseases among the poor
  owe much of their inveteracy to the accumulation of effete organic
  matters about their persons and clothes.</p>

  <p>A few more observations are called for on the quotation from
  Deuteronomy, in which allusion is made to living matter being an agent in
  the production of disease. In the curse upon the children of Israel for
  disobedience, we read that they are to be smitten with mildew. No further
  information, however, is vouchsafed to us, nevertheless, we can conceive
  the wretched condition of those on whom the curse might fall. Again, we
  find in a continuation of this curse that the Almighty uses means such as
  He adopted in the sixth plague of the Egyptians. The ashes of the furnace
  became a small dust in all the land of Egypt, breaking forth with blains
  upon man and beast. In the curse of the Israelites the words are: "The
  Lord shall make the rain of thy land <i>powder and dust</i>: from Heaven
  shall it come down upon thee until thou be destroyed."</p>

  <p>It might be conjectured that the absence of rain would be sufficient
  to account for the extinction of the people on whom the curse was
  pronounced, by the famine and drought necessarily attendant upon the loss
  of moisture. But this does not appear to be the meaning of the passage,
  for the powder and dust are mentioned as the agents of destruction;
  besides, in the continuation of the curse, the locust is to destroy the
  grain, the worm the grapes, and <!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page45"></a>{45}</span>the olive is to shed his fruit; we may thus
  take for granted that drought and famine are not to be caused by the
  showering of powder and dust, it must consequently be supposed that the
  effects of the dust in the instance of the Egyptians are to be compared
  and classified with those of the dust which smote the Israelites.</p>

  <p>As far then as Sacred History conducts us in the enquiry, concerning
  the causes of pestilences, we gain encouragement in the belief that
  living germs are the active agents, for in the case of the leprosy, we
  have evidence of reproduction in connexion with infection, which, if our
  line of argument be tenable, amounts to demonstration; then, in the other
  instances of the plagues, by boils and blains, they distinctly bear
  comparison with the accounts given by profane writers, of the visitations
  of pestilences on the earth, subsequently to those mentioned in Scripture
  history.</p>

  <p>This leads now to the consideration of recorded facts observed and
  noted during the various Epidemics in the early and subsequent periods of
  Man's History, as given by those on whom reliance may be fairly
  placed.</p>

  <p>Setting aside the uncertain information contained in the writings of
  the Chinese,<a name="NtA17" href="#Nt17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> a people
  whose <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page46"></a>{46}</span>progress in the science and practice of
  Medicine has nothing to commend it (even as it is at the present day) to
  the notice either of the physician or the historian, unless it be to the
  latter as a mark of peculiarity both in a social and political point of
  view,&mdash;passing also over the Egyptians, the Arabians, and the
  Greeks,&mdash;and even Hippocrates himself, we are driven to the Romans
  for any authentic or precise notice of Epidemic Affections. It has been
  attributed to Hippocrates that he predicted the appearance of the Plague
  at Athens, <!-- Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page47"></a>{47}</span>and that when it was introduced into Greece
  he dispelled it, "by purifying the air with fires into which were thrown
  sweet-scented herbs and flowers along with other perfumes."<a
  name="NtA18" href="#Nt18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> But little advantage can be
  derived from enquiries concerning the first appearance of any disease,
  for the probability of discovering the primary cause is certainly a <!--
  Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"></a>{48}</span>hopeless
  case, if attempted by means of the writings of ancient authors, when it
  is recollected that with all the science and learning of the ancient
  Egyptians, the use of optical instruments was not comprised among the
  paraphernalia of their arts. The knowledge that was limited to the powers
  of natural vision, where the foundation of knowledge is based upon facts
  obtained through the aid of that penetrator of nature's secrets, the
  microscope, offers no advantages to the student of the present day.</p>

  <p>To say that a disease commenced in the East and travelled westward,
  and at length found a habitation and a name in every part of the globe,
  is no more than to say that disease is coeval with the fall of man. The
  cause is as much hidden in the region of its birth, as in that where it
  sojourns for a time. The cause of the sweating sickness was as much a
  mystery in England as in all the other nations of Europe, which were
  visited by its devastating power. And these observations apply with as
  much force to one disease as another; for even our indigenous ague,
  originating in some places so limited that the shadow of a passing cloud
  may mark the boundary of its dwelling place, as inscrutably evades our
  vigilance, with all the appliances that art can bring to our assistance,
  in endeavouring to evoke its extraordinary properties under the
  cognizance of our senses.</p>

  <p>If we weigh the air which carries the poison, or analyze it by the
  most delicate chemical tests, or <!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page49"></a>{49}</span>take the weight of the atmosphere which is
  charged with it, or if we take the blood which carries the germs of the
  disease to the tissues of the body, and submit them after the work of
  destruction is accomplished, to the most rigid inspection, we can but
  exclaim,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"These are Thy marvellous works!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and confess our total inability to fathom the unbounded.</p>

  <p>If then no practical advantage can accrue from investigating the
  writings of the ancients on these subjects, beyond comparing their
  historical statements with those of more recent date, our purpose will be
  served by occasionally embodying any remarkable observations of the
  former with those of the latter.</p>

  <p>In proceeding with this course it were better to confine our minds
  chiefly to two diseases which appear from history to have been known from
  the earliest periods, these are the Plague and the Small Pox, mentioning
  other diseases only <i>en route</i>.</p>

  <p>Passing then, to the sixth century of the Christian era for the first
  distinct and connected account of the Plague, it appears from a host of
  testimony, that the history of this disease, as given by Procopius, well
  merits our attention. Drs. Friend and Hamilton, in their Histories of
  Medicine, and Gibbon, in his History of Rome, are equally warm in their
  praise of Procopius: the latter says, he "emulated the skill and
  diligence of Thucydides in the <!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page50"></a>{50}</span>description of the Plague at Athens." The
  account given by Procopius of this disease, does not differ materially
  from that given by subsequent eye-witnesses of similar pestilences. Its
  point of origin is clearly marked, and its mode of dispersion in all
  directions distinctly traced from "the neighbourhood of Pelusium, between
  the Serbonian bog and the eastern channel of the Nile." It commenced in
  the year 542. It raged in Constantinople in the following year, and it
  was in this city that our historian gathered the materials which are
  handed down to us. When, however, we anxiously look for any explanation
  as to the cause of the malady, we are told that it must have been a
  direct visitation from Heaven, in consequence of the eccentric characters
  exhibited in its wide-spreading influence, in not yielding to the
  scrutiny nor bending to the laws known to prevail, and to regulate the
  course of other diseases: neither country nor clime, age nor sex, the
  strong and healthy, nor the weakly and previously diseased, could be said
  to be free from its indiscriminate destruction.</p>

  <p>But some phenomena preceding the outbreak of the pestilence are
  observed as coincidences by all authors. Gibbon thus writes: "I shall
  conclude this chapter with the comets, the earthquakes, and the plague
  which astonished or afflicted the age of Justinian." From the accounts
  given by this author, earthquakes for some years had been threatening and
  destroying many portions of the globe, <!-- Page 51 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>{51}</span>that in the ruins of
  cities and in the chasms of the earth, great was the sacrifice of human
  life. Constantinople, which suffered so severely from the plague is said
  to have been shaken for forty days. These great disturbances of the globe
  have been always looked upon as indicating other and important influences
  of a secret or hidden nature; these impressions on the minds of the
  people are traceable throughout the histories of all epidemics, and have
  been sufficiently distinct among the people of our own time, preceding
  and during the period of infliction.</p>

  <p>From this short notice of the Plague of 543, I pass to the ninth
  century, when Rhazes, the Arabian physician, endeavoured to enlighten the
  world on the subject of Small Pox.<a name="NtA19"
  href="#Nt19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> In quoting his opinions, I am not to be
  understood as subscribing to them, but merely endeavouring to point out
  some peculiar and interesting observations.</p>

  <p>First, then, Rhazes attributes the disease to a condition of the
  blood, which he thus describes, to shew how it happens that in infancy
  and childhood the disease is most prevalent, and that old age is <!--
  Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>{52}</span>least
  liable to the affection.<a name="NtA20" href="#Nt20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
  "The blood of infants and children may be compared to <i>must</i>, in
  which the coction leading to perfect ripeness has not yet begun, nor the
  movement towards fermentation taken place; the blood of young men may be
  compared to must which has already fermented and made a hissing noise,
  and has thrown out abundant vapours and its superfluous parts, like wine
  which is now still and quiet, and arrived at its full strength, and as to
  the blood of old men, it may be compared to wine which has now lost its
  strength, and is beginning to grow vapid and sour."</p>

  <p>"Now the Small Pox arises when the blood putrifies and ferments, so
  that the superfluous vapours are thrown out of it, and it is changed from
  the blood of infants which is like must, into the blood of young men
  which is like wine perfectly ripened: and the Small Pox itself may be
  compared to the fermentation and the hissing noise which take place at
  that time."</p>

  <p>But the cause of the disease is simply alluded to by this author, as
  depending upon "occult dispositions in the air," and as he speaks here of
  Measles with the Small Pox he goes on to say&mdash;"which necessarily
  cause these diseases and predispose bodies to them." This notion of
  Rhazes that there is some peculiar condition of the blood which favours a
  process resembling fermentation is not without interest. The circumstance
  that individuals are not <!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page53"></a>{53}</span>usually liable to a second attack of the
  disease, no doubt directed the attention of this physician to compare the
  process of fermentation with disease of such a nature, seeing that when
  the whole of the saccharine matter was converted into spirit, the hissing
  noise, as he calls it, or the disengagement of carbonic acid gas would
  cease, and the capacity for fermentation be entirely gone. So that the
  occult conditions of the air, their power of inducing a disease, and
  multiplying the matter capable of engendering a similar affection, stood
  in the mind of Rhazes as analogous if not identical phenomena.</p>

  <p>We pass now without further comment to the epidemics of the Middle
  Ages; and here the work of the philosophical Hecker leaves us little else
  to desire in the way of information, as far as it is obtainable from
  published records. From the manner in which he has grouped the facts
  which presented themselves to his mind in the course of a most laborious
  research, he has saved the student of this subject much toil in acquiring
  matter for reflection; he has here but to read and digest.</p>

  <p>I know not how to select from this invaluable work the most striking
  passages, to strengthen and support my hypothesis, for not a page is
  destitute of facts corroborative of the doctrine that vital germs are the
  material agents of pestilential disorders. The opening paragraph to the
  Black Death is a most cogent illustration of the assertion; it is, as it
  were, the theme of the work. "That <!-- Page 54 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page54"></a>{54}</span>Omnipotence, which has
  called the world with all <i>its living creatures into one animated
  being</i>, especially reveals himself in the desolation of great
  pestilences. The powers of creation come into violent collision; the
  sultry dryness of the atmosphere; the subterranean thunders; the mist of
  overflowing waters are the harbingers of destruction. Nature is not
  satisfied with the ordinary alternations of life and death, and the
  destroying angel waves over man and beast his flaming sword."</p>

  <p>I must here apologise for large transcripts from Hecker's work, for
  neither could I command the amount of knowledge there displayed, nor use
  such appropriate language as the learned translator has employed.</p>

  <p>It is not doubted that the Black Death was an Oriental plague, only of
  more than usual severity, and wider spread influence of the infectious
  nature of this disease, and the active properties of the matter producing
  it. Hecker says, "articles of this kind&mdash;bedding and
  clothes&mdash;removed from the access of air, not only retain the matter
  of contagion for an indefinite period, <i>but also increase its activity,
  and engender it like a living being</i>, frightful ill consequences
  followed for many years after the first fury of the pestilence was
  past."<a name="NtA21" href="#Nt21"><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"></a>{55}</span></p>

  <p>As extraordinary atmospheric and telluric phenomena preceded the
  Plague in the time of Justinian, so do we find similar instances recorded
  as the precursor of a similar visitation 700 years later. I am concerned
  more with those circumstances which refer more especially to my subject,
  <i>viz.</i> the development of organic matter, and the peculiar odours of
  the atmosphere, the latter being evidence of some foreign and unusual
  production in our respiratory media. "On the island of Cyprus, before the
  earthquake, a pestiferous wind spread so poisonous an odour, that many
  being overpowered by it, fell down suddenly and expired in dreadful
  agonies. A thick stinking mist advanced from the east, and spread itself
  over Italy."</p>

<p><!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>{56}</span></p>

  <p>It is probable that the atmosphere contained foreign and sensibly
  perceptible admixtures to a great extent, which, at least in the lower
  regions, could not be decomposed or rendered ineffective by separation.
  In 1348 an unexampled earthquake shook Greece, Italy, and the
  neighbouring countries. During this earthquake the wine in the casks
  became turbid, a proof that changes causing a decomposition of the
  atmosphere had taken place. "The insect tribe was wonderfully called into
  life, as if animated beings were destined to complete the destruction
  which astral and telluric powers had began."</p>

  <p>"The corruption of the atmosphere came from the east, but the disease
  itself came not upon the wings of the wind, but was only excited and
  increased by the atmosphere where it had previously existed."</p>

  <p>"The most powerful of all the springs of the disease was contagion;
  for in the most distant countries, which had scarcely yet heard the echo
  of the first concussion, the people fell a sacrifice to organic poison,
  the untimely offspring of vital energies thrown into violent
  commotion."</p>

  <p>"After the cessation of the Black Plague, a greater fecundity in women
  was every where remarkable, a grand phenomena, which from its occurrence
  after every destructive pestilence, proves to conviction the prevalence
  of a higher power in the direction of general organic life." <!-- Page 57
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>{57}</span></p>

  <p>In the article Contagion, of the Essay, Sweating Sickness: "Most
  fevers which are produced by general causes, propagate themselves for a
  time spontaneously." "The exhalations of the affected become the germs of
  a similar decomposition in those bodies which receive them, and produce
  in these a like attack upon the internal organs, <i>and thus a merely
  morbid phenomenon of life, shows that it possesses the fundamental
  property of all life, that of propagating itself in an appropriate soil.
  On this point there is no doubt, the phenomena which prove it have been
  observed from time immemorial, in an endless variety of circumstances,
  but always with a uniform manifestation of a fundamental law.</i>"</p>

  <p>Mead, in his Essay on the Plague, makes many observations of great
  interest and worthy a physician of eminence; and where, in recent times,
  shall we look for any more definite information concerning the causes of
  pestilences? It is not a little singular that at the time this book was
  published, it was read with such avidity that it went through seven
  editions in one year.<a name="NtA22" href="#Nt22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>
  From this circumstance we may gather that the public generally took a
  lively and proper interest in a subject that was not only of domestic,
  but national importance. Whether this interest was stimulated by the fact
  that the work was written expressly by order of the <!-- Page 58 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>{58}</span>government, it is now
  impossible to say, at any rate much credit is due to the Lords of the
  Regency for having placed so important a duty upon one so thoroughly and
  in every way so duly qualified for the task as Dr. Mead. It had been well
  if some of the advice given at that time, as means of protection against
  the Plague, had been applied and put in force during the late visitation
  of epidemic Cholera, for, however the minds of some may be convinced of
  the non-contagiousness of Cholera, there are many who hold a different
  opinion, and all will acknowledge, that if not strictly a contagious
  affection, it is clearly proved to be capable of being carried from place
  to place, or to use Dr. Copland's words, it is "a portable disease." But
  this is not the place to discuss the subject of contagion, allusion will
  be made to it hereafter. To return, Mead's expressions are singularly
  illustrative of the vital power possessed by the germs of disease; he
  says, "There are instances of the distemper's being stopt by the winter
  cold, and yet the seeds of it not destroyed, but only kept unactive,
  <i>till the warmth of the following spring has given them new life and
  force</i>. His confession as to the hidden cause of the disease, is
  worthy transcribing: "We are acquainted too little with the laws, by
  which the small parts of matter act upon each other, to be able precisely
  to determine the qualities requisite to change animal juices into such
  acrimonious humours, or to explain <!-- Page 59 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page59"></a>{59}</span>how all the
  distinguishing symptoms attending the disease are produced."<a
  name="NtA23" href="#Nt23"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

  <p>On the spread of the Plague is the following:&mdash;"The plague is a
  <i>real poison</i>, which being bred in the southern parts of the world,
  maintains itself there by circulating from infected persons to goods,
  that when the constitution of the air happens to favour infection, it
  rages with great violence." Contagious matter is lodged in goods of a
  loose and soft texture, which being packed up, and carried into other
  countries, let out, when opened, the imprisoned seeds of contagion, and
  produce the disease whenever the air is disposed to give them force,
  "otherwise they may be dispersed without any considerable ill effects."
  Gibbon thus speaks of the above quoted work: "I have read with pleasure
  Mead's short but elegant Treatise concerning Pestilential Disorders;"
  many also might read it at the present day with infinite advantage. Mead
  most satisfactorily combats the opinions of the French physicians who
  maintained the non-contagiousness of the Plague. Experience proves beyond
  doubt, that certain conditions of atmosphere, of <!-- Page 60 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>{60}</span>which we are ignorant,
  favour the growth and increase of pestilences as they do of all
  vegetation.</p>

  <p>Dr. Bancroft was of opinion that specific contagions are each and
  severally creatures of Divine Wisdom, as distinctly and designedly
  exerted for their production, as it was to create the several species of
  animals and vegetables around us.</p>

  <p>The indigenous fever of Ireland, which has several times shewn itself
  in an epidemic form, appears to have been as fatal, as the Plague in the
  South of Europe. Its devastations have generally been associated or
  preceded by famine and general distress. Dr. Harty, writing in 1820, says
  that thrice within the last eighty years has the same fever appeared in
  its epidemic character. In the year 1741 Ireland lost 80,000 of her
  inhabitants from this cause. It is a maculated typhus, and considered to
  be a special product of the Emerald Isle. It has been shewn that fever
  began to exceed its ordinary rate in those places first where famine and
  want of employment were most severely felt,<a name="NtA24"
  href="#Nt24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> and that in such places and under such
  circumstances, it was most prevalent and fatal. The physicians generally
  believed it to have been spontaneously produced and not to have been
  imported. In the last Famine Fever of Ireland, Liverpool and several
  other places suffered severely from the <!-- Page 61 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>{61}</span>importation of their
  Channel neighbours with the disease in some instances, and the infection
  in others about their persons. Hitherto these have to all appearance been
  the limits of the affection; we know not, however, how soon the time may
  come when the invisible bonds which have thus chained the disease to
  certain localities may be severed, and spreading itself like other
  pestilences in an aggravated form, attack this country as a last and
  crowning act of retributive justice. At present it has but cost us money
  and regrets, but if the history of pestilences is to be heeded, there are
  many tokens which seem to indicate that a few slight concurrent
  circumstances only are wanting, to bring the full force of this disease
  upon us; then will there be a sacrifice of life. Edinburgh and other
  towns of Scotland have had some visitations already, ourselves but
  slightly, but let our labouring population suffer to any large extent for
  want of work, and we shall inevitably be the sufferers from that fever
  which in consequence of general destitution is now always more or less
  prevalent in Ireland.</p>

  <p>The Sweating Sickness prevailed in England alone at first, but at
  length sought foreign victims. The Cholera is an exotic disease, as well
  as the Plague, but they occasionally have visited our shores, and their
  seeds remain among us. The Small Pox is now even not known in some parts
  of the world, but when once it is established, who can predict the period
  of its first appearance in an <!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page62"></a>{62}</span>epidemic form. The history of the disease
  informs us that in all the countries where it has been introduced, sooner
  or later an epidemic has seized the inhabitants.</p>

  <p>A disease previously unknown in India appeared at Rangoon in the year
  1824, which obtained the name of Scarlatina Rheumatica. Four years
  afterwards it attacked the Southern States of North America, and though
  the disease was so impartial as scarcely to spare a single individual of
  any town to which it extended its influence, it was not accompanied with
  that mortality which has usually been the characteristic of wide spread
  epidemics.</p>

  <p>There is one peculiar feature of all epidemics which may be here
  mentioned as indicative of some definite, though at present unaccountable
  cause, operating in the sudden suppression of the disease after a certain
  period of duration. This distinctive character may almost be considered
  as a law in reference to these affections; if we take three distinct
  diseases, the Plague, the Irish Fever and the Cholera, we find the rule
  apply to all. Of the latter disease we have so recently been witnesses,
  that I need not quote authorities on this point concerning it. In Dr.
  Patrick Russell's work on the Plague at Aleppo I find the following
  remarkable passage. After alluding to the great increase of pestilential
  effluvia that there must be towards the close of an epidemic, compared
  with the amount at the onset of the disease, and expressing his <!-- Page
  63 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63"></a>{63}</span>astonishment
  that so many escape infection, he says: "The fact, however unaccountable,
  is unquestionably certain; the distemper seems to be extinguished by some
  cause or causes equally unknown, as those which concurred to render it
  more or less epidemical in its advance and at its height." He then
  mentions that in Europe the sudden cessation may be partly attributable
  to the measures adopted for preventing its extension; but "at Aleppo,
  where the disease is left to run its natural course, and few or no means
  of purification are employed, it pursues nearly the same progress in
  different years; it declines and revives in certain seasons, and at
  length, without the interference of human aid, ceases entirely."</p>

  <p>The expressions of Dr. Harty on this subject, in connexion with the
  Irish Fever, would apply as well to all other epidemics: "It is a fact,
  that though every diversity of management was resorted to for effecting
  the suppression of the disease, yet, nevertheless, there was an almost
  simultaneous and apparently spontaneous decline of the epidemic in the
  various and most remote parts of Ireland. It is not an easy matter to
  offer a satisfactory explanation of this circumstance, <i>some general
  cause must</i> no doubt have influenced the subsidence of the disease,
  yet that cause could not be atmospheric, inasmuch as the decline, though
  it might be said to be simultaneous, was not sufficiently so to admit of
  that explanation."</p>

<p class="cenhead">SECTION III.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE DISPERSION OF PLANTS AND DISEASES.</span></p>

  <p>The dispersion of Diseases and the dispersion of Plants, exhibit
  analogies which might be little expected, on a superficial view of the
  enquiry.</p>

  <p>We are led to believe, that the earth as a whole, was not covered with
  vegetation in a day, the geological history of this planet is one of
  development, and though at first sight this expression of opinion may
  appear to savour of doubt in the Mosaic record, a more extended
  acquaintance with the subject, favours rather and confirms Scripture
  history.</p>

  <p>As the peopling of the earth has been a gradual process with the
  animal creation, so has it been also with the vegetable kingdom. We see
  at the present day, that plants by various means of transit from place to
  place, multiply themselves on new soils and in new climes, the same with
  animals. By other means we observe, or can trace, the extinction from
  various localities and countries, of members of both the animal and
  vegetable kingdom.</p>

  <p>We learn that originally this planet had a temperature much higher
  than at present, and that the variation of temperature between the
  equator and the poles, which we now witness, did not obtain in the
  earlier condition of the globe. We are given to understand, and not
  without considerable proof, <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page65"></a>{65}</span>if not demonstration, that the earth was a
  vast bog, in which rank vegetation grew, and in which the ichthyosauri
  and plesiosauri, must have floundered about as unwieldy and loathsome
  bodies. We can readily conceive a condition of atmosphere at this time to
  have been loaded with pestiferous vapours of an organized nature; it is
  entirely in accordance with all we know, that it should have been so.
  Allied forms of plants to those now in existence, are found in the form
  of fossils, by which comparisons are made, but how the transition into
  the present Flora took place, or at what period, it is impossible to say.
  That these plants should have been entirely destroyed during the
  revolutions of the earth by earthquakes, and their consequences; the
  collection of waters into the vacuities formed, and their draining off
  from other places by elevations of the land, is not to be dwelt on
  without astonishment; then again the ultimate changes of temperature on
  the surface of the earth, may have been another element in the history of
  their extinction. But if we may be allowed to imagine that there were
  organic germs floating in the vapours of the atmosphere, these would
  hardly be subject to the same influences as those which depended solely
  on their fixation to the soil for subsistence. The atmosphere, their
  native element, being influenced by the commotions from below, would be
  agitated; vortiginous currents would be established, hurricanes would
  sweep over the stagnant pool and reeking morass, <!-- Page 66 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>{66}</span>and the higher regions of
  the air might have thus given protection to these subtle germs, while
  almost a total extinction of the elegant ferns, the stately palm, and the
  towering cane was in course of procedure. Then when the strife of the
  earth and elements had subsided, these would descend with the gentle
  breezes, and again find in various spots a local habitation&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Where blue mists, through the unmoving atmosphere,</p>
      <p>Scatter the seeds of pestilence <i>and feed unnatural vegetation</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the new era, when the earth took its present physiognomy, who shall
  say whether much of the pestiferous matter may not have been enclosed and
  condensed in the bowels of the earth, and when it is remembered, that
  earthquakes and convulsions of nature,<a name="NtA25"
  href="#Nt25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> have invariably preceded the outbreak of
  <!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>{67}</span>any
  great pestilences, that stinking mists, coming from some unknown regions,
  and unusual vegetations have made their appearance in concert at these
  times, what I ask is more natural than to imagine, that they have been
  let loose during the general convulsion? It may be asked, what is to be
  said about that revolution of the earth, when the great Deluge spread
  over the whole face of the globe? It can only be replied, that this is a
  part of the scheme of cosmogony into which we are not called upon to
  enter. There are yet strenuous supporters of the partial as well as total
  submersion of this planet, but whether it be true that the vast torrents
  which appear to have swept the surface uniformly in a southern direction,
  were of a date coeval with the deluge, and constituted an essential
  portion of the phenomena, of which one was, that "the fountains of the
  great deep were broken up," or whether they were anterior to this
  catastrophe, will not at all interfere with the conjecture of a very
  early formation and propagation of the germs of pestilential diseases,
  for the commotions of a deluge were less likely to interfere with the
  vapours of the atmosphere, than extensive volcanic and electric
  disturbances. Moreover, it is rather in favour of this theory, that the
  <!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page68"></a>{68}</span>regions where the temperature and
  exhalations most nearly resemble those of the former condition of the
  earth, are those in which pestilential disorders most frequently arise,
  and where their virulence has always been most strongly marked.</p>

  <p>After the various commotions which left the globe, with its present
  physiognomy of mountains, plains, valleys, rivers, lakes, and oceans; a
  new Flora and Fauna appeared to adorn and animate the scene of man's
  existence. Plants and animals were created apparently in adaptation to
  the numerous climes, which the seasons in the various latitudes or the
  elevations of the soil, were prepared to render fruitful and useful each
  in its own sphere. Besides this, the plants of the same latitude, in some
  instances, differ materially from each other; in this case it seems that
  the soil has much to do with this peculiarity, for it is certain that the
  soil and the contiguous atmosphere, have a close and intimate relation;
  the drought of the desert depends upon the sand, as humid atmosphere is
  connected with the morass. To illustrate the tendency which vegetation
  shews in appropriating one locality more than another, I may quote the
  following: "Some of the volcanic masses of the Æolian or Lipari Islands,
  that have existed beyond the reach of history, are still without a blade
  of verdure; while others in various parts, of little more than two
  hundred years date, bear spontaneous vegetation, and the same is seen on
  two lavas of Etna near each other, for the one <!-- Page 69 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>{69}</span>of 1536 is still black
  and arid, while that of 1636, is covered with oaks, fruit trees, and
  vines."</p>

  <p>In comparing the diffusion of plants, and the diffusion of diseases,
  the different modes by which this generally has been effected may be
  considered under heads, that the comparison may be more readily
  traced.</p>

  <p><i>First</i>, seeds are diffused by the atmosphere, either by the
  prevalence of certain currents, which are produced by known laws, in
  which case, no difficulty occurs in the explanations; or in a more
  imperceptible manner, as by those more uncertain atmospheric currents of
  a partial nature, which, though they seem to have laws governing them,
  are not yet understood.</p>

  <p><i>Second</i>, seeds are transported by water across oceans, &amp;c.
  when they can be floated on any material by which they are preserved, as
  by wrecks and masses of wood, which have been washed down the rivers.</p>

  <p><i>Third</i>, they are conveyed by man to all parts of the globe.</p>

  <p><i>Fourth</i>, a period of latency is observed to apply to them, that
  is, they require certain essential conditions before germination occurs;
  so that even in some localities, a plant may not have been known to exist
  in a particular neighbourhood, but by a train of circumstances, it may
  make its appearance, and again be a centre of development.</p>

  <p>1st. I shall not here wander into the speculation, <!-- Page 70
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"></a>{70}</span>whether plants
  had originally one birth-place, as a centre from which they spread by
  various agencies, as supposed by Linnæus, nor into any enquiry beyond
  those facts, which may fairly come within our own comprehension, and
  within our own means of demonstration.</p>

  <p>Many seeds are provided with means adapting them for floating in the
  atmosphere, these are by pappi, or winglets and hairs, but it cannot be
  doubted that the agency of atmospheric currents, is productive of
  considerable effects in the dispersion of lighter seeds, such as those of
  mosses, fungi, and lichens&mdash;lichens have been discovered in
  Brittany, which are peculiar to Jamaica, and Monsieur De Candolle
  concludes, that their seeds had been carried thence by the south-westerly
  winds, which prevail during a great part of the year on this portion of
  the French coast.</p>

  <p>But Humboldt's testimony on the subject of winds is most satisfactory,
  for he says, "Small singing birds, and even butterflies, are found at
  sea, at great distances from the coast (as I have several times had
  opportunities of observing in the Pacific), being carried there by the
  force of the wind, when storms come off the land." It is generally
  believed, from abundance of proofs, that the trade winds, and other
  continuous currents, are means by which plants are conveyed from one
  country to another.<a name="NtA26" href="#Nt26"><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"></a>{71}</span></p>

  <p>As to the partial currents, Humboldt further says, "The heated crust
  of the earth occasions an ascending vertical current of air by which
  light bodies are borne upwards. M. Boussingault, and Don Mariano De
  Rivero, in ascending the summit of the Silla, one of the gneiss mountains
  of Caraccas, saw in the middle of the day, about noon, whitish shining
  bodies rise from the valley to the summit of the mountain, 5755 feet
  high, and then sink down towards the neighbouring sea coast. These
  movements continued uninterruptedly for the space of an hour. The whitish
  shining bodies proved to be small agglomerations of straws, or blades of
  grass, which were recognized by Professor Kunth, for a species of vilfa,
  a genus, which together with agrostis, is very abundant in the provinces
  of Caraccas and Cumana."</p>

  <p>On the plague of locusts we read, that "the Lord brought an east wind
  upon the land, all that day and all that night, and when it was morning
  the east wind brought the locusts."</p>

  <p>On the Black Death we read, "There were many locusts which had been
  blown into the sea by a hurricane, and a dense and awful fog was seen in
  the heavens, rising in the east, and descending upon Italy."</p>

  <p>Of the Plague of 542, Gibbon says, "The winds might diffuse that
  subtle venom, but unless the atmosphere be previously disposed for its
  reception, the plague would soon expire in the cold or <!-- Page 72
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>{72}</span>temperate
  regions of the north. The disease alternately languished and revived, but
  it was not till a calamitous period of fifty-two years, that mankind
  recovered their health, or the air resumed its pure and salubrious
  quality."</p>

  <p>In the history of the Sweating Sickness, of which there were five
  distinct visitations, we find ample allusions to the atmosphere, and the
  mode in which the disease was conveyed by this medium.</p>

  <p>I quote again from Hecker: "It seemed that <i>the banks of the
  Severn</i> were the <i>focus of the malady</i>, and that from hence, a
  true impestation of the atmosphere, was diffused in every direction.
  Whithersoever the winds wafted the stinking mists, the inhabitants became
  infested with the sweating sickness. <i>These poisonous clouds of mists
  were observed moving from place to place</i>, with the disease in their
  train, affecting one town after another, and morning and evening
  spreading their nauseating insufferable stench. At greater distances,
  these clouds being dispersed by the wind, became gradually attenuated yet
  their dispersion set no bounds to the pestilence, and it was as if they
  had imparted to the lower strata of the atmosphere, <i>a kind of ferment
  which went on engendering itself even without the presence of the thick
  misty vapour</i>, and being received into men's lungs, produced the
  frightful disease everywhere."<a name="NtA27"
  href="#Nt27"><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"></a>{73}</span></p>

  <p>Mr. K. B. Martin, harbour-master of Ramsgate, in a communication to
  Lord Carlisle on the Cholera of last autumn, says, "At midnight of the
  31st August (1849), the Samson (steam-tug) proceeded to the Goodwin
  Sands, where the crew were employed under the Trinity agent, assisting in
  work carried on there by that corporation. While there, at 3 A.M. 1st
  September, <i>a hot humid haze, with a bog-like smell</i>, passed over
  them; and the greater number of the men there employed instantly felt a
  nausea. They were in two parties. One man at work on the sand was obliged
  to be carried to the boat; and before they reached the steam vessel at
  anchor, the cramps and spasm had supervened upon the vomitings; but here
  they found two of the party on board similarly affected. Here then is a
  very marked case without any known predisposing local cause. Doubtless it
  was atmospheric, and in the hot blast of pestilence which passed over
  them."</p>

  <p>Many more instances might be quoted, to shew that the germs of
  disease, as well as of plants, are borne on the wings of the wind from
  place to place <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page74"></a>{74}</span>in one country, and from one country to
  another, the distance being no obstacle, however great that may be.<a
  name="NtA28" href="#Nt28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> "Dust and sands," says
  Sharon Turner, "heavier than many seeds, are borne by the winds and
  clouds for several hundred miles across the atmosphere, falling on the
  earth and seas as they pass along." "The clouds not only bring us
  occasionally meteoric stones, hail, and <i>epidemics</i>, but also
  vegetable seeds."<a name="NtA29" href="#Nt29"><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

  <p>2nd. The transportation of seeds of plants by water requires very
  little notice; every one is familiar with the mode in which coral
  islands, which gradually rise out of the sea, become covered with
  vegetation. "If new lands are formed, the organic forces are ever ready
  to cover the naked rock with life.&mdash;Lichens form the first covering
  of the barren <!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page75"></a>{75}</span>rocks, where afterwards lofty forest trees
  wave their airy summits. The successive growth of mosses, grasses,
  herbaceous plants and shrubs or bushes, occupies the intervening period
  of long but undetermined duration."</p>

  <p>The following may be cited as an instance of the transportation of
  disease by water. "Cyprus lost almost all its inhabitants, and ships
  without crews were often seen in the Mediterranean, or afterwards in the
  North Sea, driving about, <i>and spreading the plague wherever they went
  on shore</i>."<a name="NtA30" href="#Nt30"><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It requires no argument to enforce the conviction that cottons,
  woollens, furs, skins, &amp;c. will retain the matter of infection for
  almost an indefinite period; instances of the kind have been already
  given; it is therefore easy to understand that portions of wrecks and
  ship's goods would be a frequent though unsuspected source of infection.
  Dr. Halley mentions a case, in which a bale of cotton was put on shore at
  Bermuda by stealth; it lay above a month without prejudice, where it was
  hid, but when opened and distributed among the inhabitants, it produced
  such a contagion that the living scarce sufficed to bury the dead. Dr.
  Walker found seeds dropt accidentally into the sea in the West Indies
  cast ashore on the Hebrides. He says, "the sea and rivers waft more seed
  than sails." The waters of many rivers induce diarrh&oelig;a and
  dysentery.<a name="NtA31" href="#Nt31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> Well water
  also in many <!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page76"></a>{76}</span>places has a similar effect, especially if
  any surface drainage happens to find its way into the well.</p>

  <p>3rd. The part performed by man himself in the communication of disease
  to his fellow creatures, is perhaps the most fruitful source of the
  extensive spread of epidemic and contagious diseases.</p>

  <p>In the time of Moses, restrictions were laid on those who had the
  plague of the leprosy to avoid contagion; the dictum for one so affected
  was, "he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his habitation be."<a
  name="NtA32" href="#Nt32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> All the ancient authors
  believed in the <!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page77"></a>{77}</span>infectious nature of pestilential fevers,
  and some other diseases; but, according. to Mr. Adams, they held that no
  specific virus was the cause, and merely a contamination of the
  surrounding air by effluvia from the sick. Thucydides, Hippocrates,
  Procopius, Galen, Plutarch, all recognized the property of
  communicability from one individual to another of the plague; and Hecker,
  on the epidemics of the middle ages, abounds with instances in support of
  contagion. As regards small-pox and measles, Rhazes observes particularly
  the connection that exists between the condition of the air and the
  severity or mildness of these diseases, remarking that small-pox seldom
  happens to old men, except in pestilential, putrid, and malignant
  constitutions of the air in which this disease is usually prevalent.</p>

  <p>The history of the introduction of Scarlet Fever, Hooping Cough, Lues,
  and other diseases into the various countries of the globe, is
  sufficiently convincing that men carry about with them the seeds of
  disease; that while these attach themselves to the persons and clothing
  of those who introduce them into new climes, and flourish independently
  of cultivation, yet the exotics which they foster with so much care,
  often disappoint their most sanguine expectations; and these "languishing
  in our <!-- Page 78 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page78"></a>{78}</span>hothouses can give but a very faint idea of
  the majestic vegetation of the tropical zone." Art in this procedure
  fails to accomplish here, what nature but too sadly, under some
  circumstances, effects most readily. The germs of some diseases though of
  an exotic character, under congenial influences of various kinds, appear
  to flourish with native vigour: is it not so, also, with some forms of
  vegetation? The aloe, a native of Mexico, which lives, but does not
  thrive well, or reproduce under ordinary circumstances in this country,
  will occasionally send forth a most luxuriant blossom;<a name="NtA33"
  href="#Nt33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> so rare is this, that some say it occurs
  every 50 or 100 years, but no law seems to be established on this point,
  any more than the statement that we may expect pestilential diseases at
  certain intervals. But that there are intervals of <i>uncertain</i>
  duration when the aloe will blossom, when the grapes will ripen, and a
  general productiveness of exotics will occur, is as certain as that
  seasons will occur when contagion will be rife, and a most unusual
  multiplication of disease prevail. This is not an imaginary or
  speculative notion,&mdash;all observers of seasons and diseases within
  the last twenty years, may fully verify the statement.</p>

  <p>In 1846, a large vine, the black Hambro-grape, <!-- Page 79 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page79"></a>{79}</span>ripened its fruit out of
  doors, and was as fine as any green-house production; but during nine
  years that the vine has been under my inspection, this was the only time
  I have witnessed such a result.</p>

  <p>We are apt to attribute an abundant or scarce fruit season to
  temperature alone, but this is an error&mdash;for we have before
  remarked, that though certain lands may be in the same degree of
  latitude, the plants which thrive well on one land, will not do so on the
  other: in fine, that where reason and analogy would lead one to expect a
  particular form of vegetation, a totally different Flora is presented to
  the view. These facts are indeed suggestive of new and important
  deductions. Is it yet explained why the town of Birmingham should be free
  from Cholera? There is a large manufacturing population, a great number
  of poor, the usual overcrowding of individuals in small chambers, a
  considerable amount of destitution and depravity; irregular habits of
  living, and unwholesome diet, and doubtless many parts of the town, which
  on investigation would have yielded all the elements usually considered
  necessary for the localization of the disease: but no&mdash;here was some
  repelling cause, some opposing agent to the generation and propagation of
  the pestilential seeds. There are no known laws by which inorganic matter
  could be supposed to observe such a selection, or such an antagonism.
  Electricity, magnetism, ozone, gases, exhibit no such elective properties
  that here they will destroy, and <!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page80"></a>{80}</span>there they will spare; that they can almost
  depopulate small villages, and scarcely find a victim in Birmingham and
  Bath. But if we suppose a living, and multiplying matter as the cause of
  disease, many local causes may conspire to arrest the development of the
  germs, or perhaps, even utterly destroy them.</p>

  <p>4th. As to the time of latency, facts crowd upon us indefinitely, as
  elements of comparison between vegetation generally, and disease in its
  early stages and history. The seeds of plants are extraordinarily
  tenacious of life. What a mysterious arrangement of the ultimate
  particles of matter must there be, by which the vital force remains
  apparently inactive for many years, and yet when the conditions arise
  favourable to its manifestation, as it were by an extraordinary fiat,
  life appears.</p>

  <p>Previous to the year 1715, no broom grew in the King's Park, at
  Stirling; but in that year a camp was formed there, and the surface of
  the ground consequently was broken in many places. Wherever it was
  broken, broom sprang up. The plant was subsequently destroyed; but in
  1745 a similar growth appeared after the ground had been again broken for
  a like purpose. Some time afterwards the park was ploughed up, and the
  broom became generally spread over it. "In several places in the
  neighbourhood of Edinburgh," says Professor Graham, "the breaking of the
  surface produces an abundant crop of Fumaria parviflora, <!-- Page 81
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page81"></a>{81}</span>although the
  same plant had never before been observed in the neighbourhood. It is
  impossible to say the lapse of time since these were buried, before they
  were again excited to the performance of all their vital functions." Dr.
  Graham also gives another proof of the vital force existing in seeds. "To
  the westward of Stirling there is a large peat bog, a great part of which
  has been flooded away by raising water from the River Teith, and
  discharging it into the Forth,&mdash;the under soil of clay being then
  cultivated. The clergyman of the parish standing by while the workmen
  were forming a ditch in this clay, which had been covered with fourteen
  feet of peat earth, saw some seeds in the clay which was thrown out of
  the ditch; he took some of them up and sowed them: they germinated and
  produced a crop of Chrysanthemum septum. What a period of years must have
  elapsed while the seeds were getting their covering of clay, and while
  this clay became buried under fourteen feet of peat earth!"<a
  name="NtA34" href="#Nt34"><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page82"></a>{82}</span></p>

  <p>What limit can there be to the dispersion of seeds when their vital
  properties may remain so long unimpaired? The seeds of which we have been
  speaking were, no doubt many of them, washed away with the waters of the
  Teith, and carried by the stream into the Forth; and who shall then mark
  their destination; for we have seen that by such means the most distant
  lands are supplied with vegetation; for whence come the plants which
  cover the Coral Islands, unless by the air and the water, and that both
  contribute, has been incontestably proved. Dr. Lindley states that melon
  seeds have been known to grow when forty-one years old; maize thirty
  years, rye forty years, the sensitive plant sixty years, kidney-beans a
  hundred years. But seeds in general have an indefinite period,
  apparently, at which they can retain their power of germination; for many
  of the seeds which had been kept in the herbarium of Tournefort for more
  than a century, were found to have preserved their fertility.</p>

  <p>It has now to be shewn that the germs of disease also retain their
  vital powers in a state of dormancy during a lengthened period.</p>

<p><!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>{83}</span></p>

  <p>Mead has very judiciously observed, "to breed a distemper, and to give
  force to it when bred, are two different things." He further remarks,
  that the seeds of the Plague may confine themselves to a house or two
  during a hard frosty winter, and be preserved, and again put forth their
  malignant quality as soon as the warmth of the spring gives them force.
  It is certainly very remarkable that the Plague of London, which
  commenced at the latter end of the year 1664, should "lie asleep," as
  Mead says, from Christmas to the middle of February, and then break out
  in the same parish.</p>

  <p>It has been also known that an infected bed laid by for seven years
  had done infinite mischief on being again brought into use. Indeed, it is
  quite uncertain for how long a period woollen, fur, linen, cotton, and
  other articles may retain infectious matter in a dormant state. It has
  been supposed by some that in closely packed bed and body clothes a
  multiplication of the germs may and does take place, nor do I see any
  reason why this should not be the case, for these articles contain within
  their structure the effluvia of the animal body, and they may possibly
  there find sufficient nutriment for their development. Nees von Esenbeck
  believed that some of the minute Cryptogamia were re-produced in the air,
  we are not therefore exceeding philosophical conjecture when we imagine a
  basis and substratum, though an unusual one, for the germs of vegetation.
  Exclusion from air and light, <!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page84"></a>{84}</span>however, as would be the case in packed-up
  clothes, would <i>a priori</i> give a better colour to the conjecture, as
  these are the usual conditions necessary for the growth of seeds.</p>

  <p>Small Pox and Cow Pox matter, which are now proved to be the same
  virus, the former modified by having been through a process of growth and
  maturation in the cow, are both remarkable for exhibiting their active
  properties after having lain dormant for a considerable time. And each,
  though so closely allied, retaining its specific properties.</p>

  <p>This peculiarity in the history of Small Pox virus suggests a
  comparison with some phenomena of vegetation, <i>viz.</i> that of
  grafting or budding. The lower Cryptogamia in their fructifications
  resemble rather multiplication by buds than by seeds. M. Moyen's idea is
  that every spore or little globule, independently of its neighbouring
  one, lives, absorbs, assimilates, grows, and re-produces on its own
  account; this is certainly the characteristic of the Torula and the
  Uredo, and doubtless is so of many other of the Cryptogamia, the
  Protococcus nivalis is another instance. Other modes of cultivation
  produce also great varieties of results of an unexpected kind.</p>

  <p>Would any one, says Dr. Walker, imagine that cabbage, cauliflower,
  savoy, kale, brocoli, and turnip-rooted cabbage, were the same species?
  yet nothing is more certain than that they are only varieties produced by
  the cultivation of the Brassica oleracea, <!-- Page 85 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>{85}</span>a plant which grows wild
  on the sea-shores of Europe.</p>

  <p>These varieties in vegetables have now become permanent, and though it
  is supposed that each is liable to return to its original condition, I am
  not yet certain that such is the tendency. A deterioration is not
  unlikely to ensue in the course of time, because the propagation by seeds
  must necessarily very much approach the system of intermarriage, on which
  Mr. Walker has so ably written and clearly shewn that as a result we may
  invariably expect a deterioration of the species. Dr. Darwin has also
  poetically described what his experience taught him.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"So grafted trees with shadowy summits rise,</p>
      <p>Spread their fair blossoms and perfume the skies,</p>
      <p><i>Till canker taints the vegetable blood</i>,</p>
      <p>Mines round the bark and feeds upon the wood;</p>
      <p>So years successive from perennial roots,</p>
      <p>The wire or bulb with lessened vigour shoots,</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The minute nature of the germs of disease preclude all possibility of
  their being submitted, as far as we know at present, to the inspection of
  the physiologist, but we may infer many facts from results. In the same
  way, though with humbler <!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page86"></a>{86}</span>ideas, as Cuvier could build up an animal
  from a single bone, can we by a combination of facts infer the existence
  of living beings and conjecture their forms. "The re-production or
  generation of living organized bodies is the great criterion or
  characteristic which distinguishes animation from mechanism." We find the
  virus of Small Pox, according to Mr. Ceely's experiments, developing
  itself as a constitutional disease upon the cow, and becoming modified
  into a form known as the Cow Pox; this resembles the process of
  cultivation by which a species is converted into a variety, this variety
  remains for a certain time persistent; the time is not yet known, but it
  is known that by degrees, as stated above, a deterioration occurs, and
  fertility becomes impaired, "a waning lineage verging to decay," and this
  has been observed as a feature in the result of vaccination. I believe
  Dr. Gregory was one of the first to notice this fact, and deemed it
  necessary to obtain fresh lymph from the cow; this has been done, and it
  is not improbable, if the analogy we have drawn be correct, that the
  slowly spreading scepticism regarding vaccination may be arrested in its
  progress. If we can explain the deterioration of cow pox virus on this
  principle we have a hold at once upon the public, and can assure them
  that the efficacy of the proceeding is as certain as in the time of
  Jenner. The people, I contend, have a right to demand of us the reason
  why vaccination is not so efficacious as formerly, and I <!-- Page 87
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>{87}</span>affirm as
  unhesitatingly that we are bound to give the subject our most earnest
  attention.<a name="NtA35" href="#Nt35"><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Now concerning the re-production of Cow Pox matter, and assuming it to
  resemble that of the lower Cryptogamia, we can easily understand how
  degeneration in a course of years should ensue, for we find that though
  the Small Pox is a constitutional disease, that produced by vaccine lymph
  is a local affection, so that it bears the relation that grafting does to
  vegetation, and it is not improbable that such a modification takes place
  in the germs by passing through or becoming generated in the blood of the
  cow, that they entirely lose their original and characteristic form of
  reproduction: the seeds of the disease were originally capable of
  vegetating, if I may be allowed to use the term, by diffusion through the
  atmosphere; they now, however, have lost that property, and require to be
  grafted to exhibit any manifestation of vitality.</p>

  <p>How often will the seeds of a cultivated fruit grow? If you bud it
  upon another plant, you obtain a being exactly like the parent, but this,
  as we have seen, deteriorates in a course of years, we have also seen
  that the virus deteriorates; but not to stretch this point to an unseemly
  length, I cannot avoid expressing my conviction, that these are elements
  of comparison, possessing an interest and a practical utility of no small
  value.</p>

<p><!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"></a>{88}</span></p>

  <p>I have before said, that the reproduction in the Cryptogamia, rather
  resembles budding than seeding. If we observe the Torula, or take the
  process of all formation, generally it will be found to accord more
  exactly with the budding than the seeding process, and this peculiarity
  is not confined to vegetation, it is also a marked feature in the
  reproduction of infusoria, sponges, polypes, &amp;c.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"New buds surround the microscopic plant."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The reproduction of plants and animals appears to be of two kinds,
  solitary and sexual; the former occurs in the formation of the buds of
  trees, and the bulbs of tulips.</p>

  <p>The microscopic productions of spontaneous vitality propagate by
  solitary generation only.</p>

  <p>We have but reached the threshold of this vast and interesting
  subject, the experiments which suggest themselves to the mind while
  reflecting upon it, would alone occupy a whole life of leisure, and I can
  but feel how forcibly Mr. Sewell's words apply to us: "The grand field of
  investigation lies immediately before us, we are trampling every hour
  upon things which to the ignorant seem nothing but dirt, but to the
  curious are precious as gold."</p>

  <p>It is difficult, perhaps, to bring many instances, in which the germs
  of disease have lain dormant for a lengthened period, because many may
  take exception to them, from the fact, that sporadic cases of <!-- Page
  89 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"></a>{89}</span>most epidemic
  and infectious diseases, are rarely absent from any country in which
  those diseases have become indigenous, and these cases may be said to be
  the foci whence originates the epidemic constitution of the air; this,
  however, would not invalidate the supposition, because one of two
  inferences must be drawn, either that the germs of disease always exist
  in a dormant state, requiring circumstances and conditions only for their
  development, or that the germs are imported from some distant locality,
  where the disease has occurred, and finding a nidus there, grow and
  multiply.<a name="NtA36" href="#Nt36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> Whichever
  notion we take, however, matters very little to the fact of the dormancy
  of the germs, for in both, a certain period elapses between their
  transmission and their propagation. It may fairly be presumed, that
  sometimes one method may apply <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page90"></a>{90}</span>and sometimes the other, perhaps both during
  general epidemic conditions of the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>The Oidium vitis attacked the vines partially last year, and I believe
  generally spared other forms of vegetation; but this year in my vicinity,
  cucumbers, melons, and vegetable marrows, are all suffering more or less
  under the disease.<a name="NtA37" href="#Nt37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> How
  shall we say, whether are the seeds of last year the cause of the general
  diffusion at the present time, or were there a sufficient number of old
  and dormant seeds, universally diffused, and only waiting opportunities
  for multiplying themselves? We are here on the horns of a dilemma; and
  spontaneous generation, from which one naturally shrinks, can alone
  extricate us, if we do not admit diffusion and dormancy. I think I may,
  without undue assumption, affirm that a period of latency of indefinite
  duration, applies as cogently to the germs of disease as to those of
  plants.</p>

  <p>There is yet one other point in connection with this subject, and that
  is the apparent extinction of some diseases, at any rate their
  non-appearance in certain localities, which had been at one time
  congenial to them, and in which they flourished. We have seen, in
  illustrating the dormancy of seeds, that the broom must have been a
  common plant at <!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page91"></a>{91}</span>some considerable period back, in the King's
  Park at Stirling, or on that site.</p>

  <p>Then again, the appearance of Fumaria parviflora in the vicinity of
  Edinburgh, in several places where the ground is broken, is sufficiently
  convincing that this plant must once have been a common form of
  vegetation there; and as it had never before been observed in the
  neighbourhood, there must have been a combination of peculiar
  circumstances capable of rendering germination impossible, otherwise a
  continued multiplication, as in other forms of vegetation, would have
  followed of necessity.</p>

  <p>But besides these instances, how many are passing under our own eyes
  of the disappearance of plants under the influence of cultivation, and
  the generation of the noxious fumes arising from different and
  innumerable manufactories. In the vicinity of large cities and
  manufacturing towns, how rarely do we see healthy vegetation; shrubs and
  animals drag on a sickly and almost unprolific existence, and their term
  of natural life is much shortened.</p>

  <p>And if we compare diseases with this peculiar feature of vegetation,
  how very close do we find the analogies. The Sweating Sickness which
  appeared in the latter part of the fifteenth century, and at certain
  intervals multiplied and extended itself at first only in this country,
  but ultimately more or less over the continent of Europe, has <!-- Page
  92 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>{92}</span>never since
  the year 1551 shewn any symptom of productiveness, indeed for all we know
  the disease may be extinct; on the other hand, it is impossible to say
  whether or not circumstances may arise, under which it may commence
  again, to put forth its energies and again desolate the land.<a

  <p>Since 1665, the Bubo-plague has not found a congenial soil in this
  country, or if the seeds be here, which is more than probable, the
  necessary conditions to excite them to activity do not exist.</p>

  <p>It cannot be imagined that with all the merchandize which comes into
  this country from the Mediterranean, but that an abundance of the germs
  of the disease are annually brought into our ports, and disseminated
  throughout the land. The law by which we have seen that they possess a
  power of vitality and reproduction, holds now as it did in former
  times;&mdash;the properties of matter never alter, but the conditions
  under which they exist may be so modified, as to influence their
  properties, and the usual course of their operations. It is therefore to
  <!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"></a>{93}</span>an
  alteration or modification of conditions that we are to look for the
  exemption, during the last two centuries, from an invasion of the Plague.
  To say what those conditions may be in their totality is difficult,
  perhaps impossible. We may generalize on the subject, and imagine the
  reason discovered, but all those causes which were said to have conspired
  to favour the spread and contamination with Plague, were as distinctly
  specified and attributed, as the cause of our late infliction with
  Epidemic Cholera. Why then did we have the Cholera and not the Plague? To
  what particular element was it&mdash;in the mode of living, of
  destitution, of filth and want of drainage&mdash;can it be ascribed that
  we suffer under one disease, and not under the other?</p>

  <p>We have made some few observations and comparisons on the mode of
  dispersion of plants and diseases,&mdash;but there is yet one more point
  which invites notice. Not only do seasons vary in their effects on
  vegetation in a remarkable and unexplained manner, but there are many
  localities to which some special form of vegetation attaches, and which
  appear to have a power of exclusion of other forms; and as yet I have not
  been able to trace the connexion, nor can I discover it in the writings
  of botanists and travellers, who would be most likely to have sought an
  explanation of so interesting and curious a fact. Dr. Prichard has on
  this subject some very apposite illustrations. "Still further southward,
  the austral temperated zone completely <!-- Page 94 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page94"></a>{94}</span>changes the physiognomy
  of vegetation, and the Isle of Norfolk has, in common with New Holland,
  the Auracania found also in the harbour of Balade, and with New Zealand,
  the Phormium tenax. It is however remarkable, that this vast island,
  composed of two lands, separated by a channel, though so near New
  Holland, and lying under the same latitude, differs from it so
  completely, that they display no resemblance in their vegetation. Yet New
  Zealand, so rich in genera peculiar to its soil, and little known, has
  some Indian plants: such as Pepper, the Olea, and a reniform Fern, which
  is said to exist in the Isle of Maurice."</p>

  <p>I must quote one more passage from Dr. Prichard's excellent work. "We
  have one instance of an island at no great distance from a continent,
  having a peculiar vegetation. Mr. R. Brown has remarked, that there is
  not even a single indigenous species characterising the vegetation of St.
  Helena, that has been found either on the banks of the Congo, or on any
  other part of the Western coast of Africa. Does the diversity of marine
  and atmospheric currents more completely separate this island from the
  continent, than its situation would imply; or are the nature of soil and
  other local circumstances, the cause of so marked a diversity? The last
  supposition seems the most probable; because not only the species of
  plants, but likewise the genera in St. Helena, are different from those
  of the African coast." <!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page95"></a>{95}</span></p>

  <p>We are not without instances of diseases, observing this peculiarity
  which attaches to plants; but their specific characters have hardly been
  sufficiently considered in reference to climate and situation, together
  with diet and local influences, to afford us accurate data for
  comparison. It has, however, been remarked, in every country where
  Epidemics have prevailed, that some districts or tracts of country,
  though supposed to possess all the qualities favourable to the
  development of the diseases, have nevertheless been entirely or nearly
  free from them. The following passage on the course of the Cholera gives
  an example of this peculiarity. "Whenever the malady deviated, so to
  speak, from its normal direction, and passed towards the west, it seemed
  incapable of propagating itself; and <i>died away spontaneously, even in
  places which appeared to be well fitted for its reception</i>.&mdash;The
  rich fertile and densely peopled countries to the right of the Dneiper,
  enjoyed an equal freedom from attack, which can only be explained by the
  fact that they were situated <i>beyond the line of the disease</i>." With
  this I close the subject of the diffusion of plants and diseases, though
  it would require a volume of itself, to record all that has been noticed.
  I have endeavoured to select such instances as shall mark distinctly the
  features which point to comparison without overloading the enquiry.</p>

<p class="cenhead">SECTION IV.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE RELATION BETWEEN EPIDEMIC AND ENDEMIC DISEASES.</span></p>

  <p>Epidemic diseases, which multiply their germs in any climate, and
  under apparently the most varying conditions of temperature and
  hygrometric and electrical states of atmosphere, offer many points of
  contrast with Endemic affections, and many of relationship. The latter
  are traceable to a certain extent, to geological and geographical
  positions of the localities where they are observed to prevail, in
  combination with atmospheric vicissitudes and peculiarities, as well as
  to extent of cultivation of the soil: it has been remarked that the
  sickly island (as it is called) of St. Lucia has certain salubrious
  parts, but these are where sulphur abounds; this geological peculiarity
  has been deemed sufficient to account for the absence of endemic
  affections in these parts, and with much force of reason; for in the
  neighbourhoods where sulphur or sulphurous acid, a compound of sulphur,
  is an element prevalent in the soil or atmosphere, vegetation and the
  ague disappear together.</p>

  <p>Now ague, and other endemic fevers, doubtless originate from some
  allied, if not identical cause; for the localities in which they appear
  have so many <!-- Page 97 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page97"></a>{97}</span>features in common, that we are constrained
  to acknowledge that endemic fevers have some relations and analogies,
  though not yet unravelled.</p>

  <p>Geographical situation, together with certain vegetation, particularly
  of grounds which grow rice, is one remarkable for the production of
  endemic affections. But the soil which generates or gives force to the
  contaminating matter, is not alone the part where human beings feel its
  influence most severely. A low marshy ground, prolific of malaria, may be
  comparatively free; while some neighbouring elevated land, to which
  prevailing currents of air waft the volatile elements of disease, may be
  desolated by their virulent and concentrated action. "Malaria may be
  conveyed a considerable distance from its source, <i>and be condensed</i>
  in the exhaled vapour, when attracted by hills or acclivities in the
  vicinity, and when there are no high trees or woods to confine it, or to
  intercept it in its passage."</p>

  <p>The inhabitants of the city of Abydos were at one time subject to
  disease, arising from malaria, generated in some neighbouring marshes; by
  draining these marshes, which suspended the growth of rank vegetation,
  the city became healthy.</p>

  <p>Rome is in like manner even now subject to fevers, having a similar
  origin. Sir James Clark says, "Among the more prevalent diseases of Rome,
  malaria fevers are the most remarkable, and claim our first notice." He
  considers the fevers to be of exactly the same nature as those of
  Lincolnshire <!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page98"></a>{98}</span>and Essex in this country, of Holland, and
  certain districts over the greater part of the globe. To the climate, the
  season, or the concentration of the cause of these fevers, he attributes
  their varieties. It is the same disease, he says, whether from the swamps
  of Walcheren, or the pestilential shores of Africa.</p>

  <p>From July to October the inhabitants of Rome are most subject to these
  affections.</p>

  <p>Sir James Clark further says: "It may be stated as a general rule,
  that houses in confined shaded situations, with damp courts or gardens,
  or standing water close to them, are unhealthy in every climate and
  season; but especially in a country subject to intermittent fevers, and
  during summer and autumn. The exemption of the central parts of a large
  town from these fevers, is explained by the dryness of the atmosphere,
  and by the comparative equality of temperature which prevails there."</p>

  <p>In this respect there is a marked difference between an epidemic and
  an endemic affection; for when an epidemic disease attacks a city or town
  we do not discover that the central parts are more exempt than others;
  indeed, it is rather the contrary; for the most crowded parts of towns
  and cities are those, if not exactly in the centre, which would be
  comprised in a space nearer to the centre than the circumference; and it
  has been in those parts generally where the epidemic influences seem to
  have exercised the most potent sway. One would more naturally suppose,
  that a city surrounded by <!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page99"></a>{99}</span>paludal miasm, and not itself being capable
  of generating the poison, should be more affected at the circumference,
  from the simple fact that the paludal germs, which rise in the air, are
  suspended in the fogs and dews of the atmosphere. These, unless widely
  dispersed by the winds, would remain within a comparatively confined
  space; and those situations nearest to them would be most subject to
  their influence. Besides, it has been shewn, that a small wood or hill,
  or even a wall, has been sufficient to cut off or obstruct the paludal
  miasm.</p>

  <p>Without enumerating all the known endemic diseases, two or three may
  be alluded to for our present purpose; viz. that of shewing that endemic
  and epidemic diseases have a similar origin.<a name="NtA39"
  href="#Nt39"><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It is well known that under certain favouring conditions an endemic
  may become a malignant and pestilential disease; that Yellow Fever, which
  is always endemic in the west, Cholera in the east, and the Plague in the
  south of Europe and north of Africa, every few years takes on an epidemic
  form, and desolates considerable tracts of country.<a
  href="#Nt39"><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Pestilence which raged in the summer and autumn of 1804 in Spain,
  commenced at Malaga, and remained for a considerable time confined to its
  <!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page100"></a>{100}</span>boundaries, in consequence of the measures
  of precaution that were used, in preventing all communication between the
  inhabitants of the infected city and those living in the surrounding
  country. It was only in consequence of persons escaping through the
  cordon, and passing into the interior of the country, that the disease
  spread, and extended its ravages to distant places.</p>

  <p>It appears to be quite clear, that this disease may properly be
  considered in the first instance of endemic origin; but the tendencies,
  atmospheric and otherwise, were such as to favour its multiplication in
  other districts than that in which it first came into active existence.
  From this we may infer, that the seeds of the disease were dormant, and
  only became roused into vital activity by fortuitous circumstances. Dr.
  Rush states, that the endemic disorders of Pennsylvania were converted,
  by clearing the soil, to bilious and malignant remittents, and to
  destructive epidemics. Dr. Copland says, it has been observed, especially
  in warm climates, and in hot seasons in temperate countries, that when
  the air has been long undisturbed by high winds and thunder-storms, and
  at the same time hot and moist, endemic diseases have assumed a very
  severe and even epidemic character.</p>

  <p>Dr. Robertson also confirms this view. "Endemic diseases, in cases of
  neglect and preposterous management, are found to become more malignant
  even in the most temperate climates; and to <!-- Page 101 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page101"></a>{101}</span>generate a matter in
  their course, capable of producing a particular disease in any
  circumstances. <i>Indeed the origin of every</i> contagious fever
  unattended with eruptions, with the exception of Plague, must commence in
  this way." Why Dr. Robertson should except eruptive Fevers and Plague I
  cannot understand, for they must have had a commencement; and their many
  points of similarity indicate, if not an identical, an analogous source
  to other endemic fevers.</p>

  <p>It will doubtless be generally acknowledged that endemic and epidemic
  diseases depend upon some unknown agents, having their source in
  malarious districts, and being capable of assuming either a contagious or
  non-contagious character, according to circumstances.</p>

  <p>If, therefore, we find that under any conditions an endemic affection
  becomes capable of being propagated by contagion, the same law will hold
  with regard to it as to the Plague; that the power of reproduction in
  this matter is evidence of life, according to the doctrine laid down in
  the earlier part of this work. But whether or not infection be admitted,
  a matter generated in a malarious district, if confined in its effects to
  that district alone, would not necessarily imply an inorganic nature of
  the poison; for it is difficult to understand how inorganic poison,
  prevailing generally over a certain tract of country, could select
  particular individuals for its victims. If chloroform, chlorine, carbonic
  acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, or even spores of poisonous fungi, (as <!--
  Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page102"></a>{102}</span>supposed by Mitchell, which, as he regards
  their effects, would act in a similar manner to inorganic compounds) were
  the agents, all persons would suffer more or less, and the majority be
  similarly affected. We do not find that uniformity of symptoms, which
  attend upon the exhibition of poisons in the ordinary acceptation of the
  term, poisoning. This subject shall be more particularly considered, when
  treating of the influence of organic germs on animals and plants.</p>

  <p>The history of the Eclair steamer is particularly interesting, as
  shewing the extraordinary tenacity with which the germs of disease attach
  themselves to vessels, which we may call floating houses.</p>

  <p>The crew of the Eclair contracted Yellow Fever on the coast of Africa,
  and a number of them died. The remainder, sick and well, landed at Bona
  Vista, one of the Cape de Verde Islands, and the vessel underwent a
  process of washing, whitewashing, and fumigating. Nevertheless, on the
  return of the ship's company, the disease broke out again with equal
  intensity, and the vessel was ordered home. Sixty-five out of 146
  officers and men, who composed the crew, died of the disease before
  reaching Portsmouth, and twenty-three were sick at the time of
  arrival.</p>

  <p>Eight days after the Eclair left Bona Vista, a Portuguese soldier who
  had mixed with her crew died in the fort which had been occupied by them.
  Other soldiers then fell sick, and the fort was abandoned. The fever
  still spread.</p>

  <p>From the 20th September, when the first soldier <!-- Page 103 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>{103}</span>was attacked, to the
  first week in December, the fever continued to rage, and at that period
  it had found its way into almost all the country villages. The fever was
  believed to be the genuine black vomit fever; it proved contagious almost
  without exception to the nurses of the sick.</p>

  <p>This is an abstract of Mr. Rendell's letter to Lord Aberdeen, Mr.
  Rendell being British Consul at Bona Vista.</p>

  <p>Now at the time the fever broke out in the island the weather was
  extraordinarily hot, and much rain had fallen, and the town itself was
  badly drained and in a filthy state; can it be imagined then that the
  seeds of a disease liable to assume a pestilential character should lie
  dormant or be annihilated under circumstances the most favourable for
  their development, especially when we know that endemic diseases may
  assume a malignant character?</p>

  <p>This is just one of many cases which confirm our opinion in this
  respect, that plants and diseases are not long in making their appearance
  where the soil and atmosphere are congenial.</p>

  <p>The tenacity with which the disease attached itself to the Eclair is
  sufficiently explained in the absence of due ventilation; in fact, that
  in the first instance there was no ventilation at all in the hold of the
  ship. This also the more readily affords a clue to the disaster through
  all its stages, first in the contraction of the disease as an endemical
  affection in the vessel; secondly, in the multiplication of the <!-- Page
  104 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"></a>{104}</span>germs in
  the damp ill-ventilated hold, in a warm climate; and thirdly, the
  persistence and entire localization of the disease to the vessel when it
  arrived in the climate of the British shores; while, fourth and lastly,
  in the unusually hot and damp island of Bona Vista, the seeds of the
  disease were sown, and, as we might expect, multiplied indefinitely.</p>

  <p>The consecutive attacks of the crew of the Eclair shew that here a
  noxious gas or a vaporized inorganic poison could not have been the cause
  of the disease, for as I have before said, in this case the attacks
  should have been simultaneous; we find, on the contrary, that as the
  depressing effects of the melancholy condition of the crew was almost
  hourly undermining the health of the stoutest of them they as surely
  became the victims. The Kroomen, or natives on board the ship had not
  suffered, shewing that they were inured to the miasm, or were destitute
  of that condition of blood which would be favourable to a propagation of
  the materies of the disease.</p>

  <p>The Eclair we learn had left Bona Vista eight days when the first
  victim breathed his last; this would give perhaps three or four days for
  the incubation of the disease in the patient, or supposing he had not
  contracted the germs of the disease before the crew of the Eclair left
  the fort, some local favouring conditions were the means of keeping the
  germs in a fertilizing state, for it is clear from this spot the
  infection spread as from a centre or focus. <!-- Page 105 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>{105}</span>Such instances as these
  might be multiplied to extend the length of the enquiry, but, I think, to
  little advantage. The chief facts to be gathered are that an endemic
  affection became epidemic and pestilential, contrary to its usual mode,
  for the Portuguese official physician, on being consulted by the Governor
  of the Island as to the safety of landing the contaminated crew, said,
  "No danger at all; I have often brought sick men on shore coming in
  vessels from the African coast, and I never knew any ill effects to
  arise." Putting the most reasonable construction on this emphatic and
  straightforward language, we may presume that ordinary, remittent, and
  yellow fever had been commonly imported into the island, for it is not to
  be supposed but that both forms of disease must have existed among those
  sick men who had "<i>often been landed</i>," under the sanction of the
  Portuguese physician.</p>

  <p>To take another instance; intermittent fever or ague, is a disease
  known among almost all nations of the world, but it usually occurs in the
  endemic form only. It is universally supposed to depend entirely upon
  marsh effluvia, and we are accustomed to consider it as attaching only to
  low lying countries;<a name="NtA40" href="#Nt40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> but
  this is not always the case, for disease in <!-- Page 106 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page106"></a>{106}</span>this respect, like
  vegetation, may be found in various latitudes, to accommodate itself at
  varying altitudes, to the temperature and climatic relations, so as to
  appear indigenous. But though our prejudices are in favour of a simple
  miasmatic source of ague, as its sole cause, there are some who believe
  in its infectious nature. M. Sigaud, in his work on the Climate and
  Diseases of Brazil, speaks of Epidemics of <i>grave intermittent
  Fever</i>, and Dr. Copland says, that the epidemic prevalence of ague is
  a better established fact than its infection, and has been admitted by
  most writers.<a name="NtA41" href="#Nt41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> We have,
  therefore, but to go one step further to arrive at infection, after
  having found that an endemic disease under peculiar circumstances, though
  but rarely, becomes <!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page107"></a>{107}</span>epidemic. The number of persons attacked
  by ague in a malarious district, in proportion to the population, is not
  so great as might be expected, considering that they are always subject
  by night and day, more or less, to respire the air containing the germs
  of intermittent fever; we might, therefore, deny the paludal source of
  the affection, as reasonably as deny infection, if we found that
  occasionally, persons, though subject to all the usual influences, yet
  escaped all injurious consequences.</p>

  <p>There are grades and varieties of infectious diseases, from the most
  inveterate to the most mild and doubtful; but that all, without
  exception, which can in any way be traced to a specific generating and
  organic cause, may assume an exalted infectious character, and that the
  most inveterate, on the contrary, may more resemble the mild and
  doubtfully infectious forms, is a conviction that must be forced on all
  who pursue this enquiry with unbiassed interest.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE REASONABLENESS OF THE APPLICATION
OF THE FACTS TO THE INFERENCE.</p>

<p class="cenhead">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="cenhead">SECTION I.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE CHEMICAL THEORY OF EPIDEMICS UNTENABLE.</span></p>

  <p>It has been inferred that the germs of disease possess the property of
  vitality, and a number of facts have been adduced to support the
  proposition that vitality is the indwelling force by which the matter
  generating epidemic and endemic disease exercises its influence over man
  and animals. The reasonableness of the application of these facts to the
  end in view has now to be considered. Chemistry cannot account for
  epidemics.</p>

  <p>Our first subject of reflection points to the chemical discoveries of
  the last few years, and particularly to those of the great German chemist
  Liebig. We find in the first paragraph of his Organic Chemistry applied
  to Physiology and Pathology, the following words: "In the animal ovum, as
  well as in the seed of the plant, we recognize a certain remarkable
  force, <i>the source of growth</i> or increase in the mass, <i>and of
  reproduction</i> or of supply of the matter consumed; a force in a state
  of rest. By the action of external influences, by impregnation, by the
  presence of air and moisture, the condition <!-- Page 109 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>{109}</span>of static equilibrium
  is disturbed. This force is called the <i>vital force</i>, <i>vis
  vitæ</i>, or vitality."</p>

  <p>The doctrine of Liebig, that the vital force manifests itself in two
  conditions, or rather, that it is known to be in two different states,
  that of static equilibrium as in the seed, and in a dynamic state, as in
  that of growth and reproduction, is perfectly applicable to the germs of
  disease; the static equilibrium is referrible to the matter of vaccine
  lymph when dried and preserved for use, and the dynamic forces of the
  matter are known to be in operation during its reproduction and growth in
  the system of the vaccinated child.</p>

  <p>Then as to reproduction of matter by any chemical process, our author
  can furnish us with no examples, for even in his explanation of the
  causes of disease he is quite silent on this point, merely acknowledging
  that diseased products must be either rendered "harmless, destroyed, or
  expelled from the body." He further says, that "in all diseases where the
  formation of contagious matter and of exanthemata is accompanied by
  fever, two diseased conditions simultaneously exist, and two processes
  are simultaneously completed," and that it is by means of the blood as a
  carrier of oxygen that neutralization or equilibrium is established.
  Liebig thus admits that an agent exists in the blood, capable of
  deteriorating it at the expense of the oxygen, which he maintains is
  contained in the red globules; he further acknowledges that two processes
  of diseased <!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page110"></a>{110}</span>action are going on at the same time, and
  though he does not explain them, I imagine him to mean that new
  contagious matter is generated and eliminated from the blood, and that at
  the same time, there is that condition of body which he would call simply
  a diseased state, and characterizes it thus: "Disease occurs when the sum
  of vital force which tends to neutralize all causes of disturbance, (in
  other words, when the resistance offered by the vital force) is weaker
  than the acting cause of the disturbance."</p>

  <p>If I rightly apprehend his notions, they perfectly harmonize with my
  ideas, to a certain extent, on the subject. They accord, at any rate,
  most completely with the theory attempted to be established, and fully
  confirm the reasonableness of the application of the facts recorded to
  the inference drawn from other sources. The difference only rests on the
  question whether vitalized or non-vitalized matter is the <i>fons et
  origo mali</i>.</p>

  <p>How is the production of new matter, resembling that originally
  causing the disease, to be explained by any known hypothesis, except on
  the assumption of living organized matter? Though Liebig and Mulder both
  deny the fact, that the Torula cerevisiæ is the sole agent in the process
  of fermentation: they both equally fail in shewing upon what it does
  depend, and their difficulty rests entirely on their incapacity to
  explain the uniform reproductive properties of the matter engaged in
  this, as well as in all other allied operations. Liebig's statement <!--
  Page 111 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page111"></a>{111}</span>however on this matter requires
  notice&mdash;he says, "that <i>putrifying</i> blood, white of egg, flesh
  and cheese, produce the same effects in a solution of sugar, as yeast or
  ferment. The explanation is simply this; that ferment or yeast is nothing
  but vegetable fibrine, albumen or caseine, in a state of
  decomposition."</p>

  <p>This state of decomposition, however, involves a much more complex
  proceeding, than simply a reduction of matter into its elementary forms
  of gases, earths, and minerals; for we nowhere find decomposition of this
  kind going on without the development of some organized bodies, either
  animal or vegetable: and since we have seen that the spores of the
  cryptogami are always in existence in the atmosphere, and making their
  appearance under favouring conditions, and especially when we find that
  fermentation is invariably accompanied, and I may safely say, preceded by
  the deposition in the fluid of the sporules of the Torula, we can hardly
  believe that they are any other than the sole agents of the process. I
  have now a considerable quantity of the Torula obtained from the urine of
  a diabetic patient, in which they appeared, as it were, spontaneously.
  After the urine had been allowed access to the air for a certain time,
  and the whole of the saccharine matter was converted into new compounds,
  reproduction of the Torula ceased;&mdash;and those which remained when
  the process was completed, still continue as organic cells, deposited
  <!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page112"></a>{112}</span>in the bottle in an inert state, but
  ready, on the addition of fresh sugar, as has been proved, to resume an
  active existence. These germs, it is now well known, may be dried into
  powder, so as to be blown away like dust without any, or but little,
  detriment to their vital energies; and there is now no doubt that they
  exist in this condition in the air, as do the spores of mucor,
  aspergillus, oidium, agaricus, and all other fungi.</p>

  <p>Mulder, however, does allow some properties to the yeast vesicle; he
  says, "a variety of strange ideas have been entertained respecting the
  nature of yeast; recent experiments have convinced me that it undoubtedly
  is a cellular plant consisting of isolated cells. They resemble the
  composition of cellulose in some respects, but differ from it in many."
  "These vesicles, consisting of a substance resembling that of cells, do
  not contribute in the least to the fermentation, but are exosmotically
  penetrated during fermentation by the protein compound." These chemists
  seem to have an instinctive horror of allowing any active properties to
  the yeast vesicle, that is as far as the conversion of sugar into
  carbonic acid and alcohol is concerned in the act of fermentation. Dr.
  Carpenter, as if desiring to conciliate the chemical and physiological
  disputants, considers that the truth is to be found in the mean of the
  two extremes,&mdash;that is, that the process of fermentation is neither
  entirely dependent on chemical laws, nor on those laws which preside <!--
  Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"></a>{113}</span>over
  the growth of reproductive matter, but is a process in which both perform
  certain offices, each depending on the other to produce the combined
  result; he thus approaches more nearly to the theory of Mulder, than that
  of Liebig.</p>

  <p>But to revert to Mulder, he speaks of the Torula cells being
  "exosmotically penetrated during the process of fermentation by the
  protein compound." Now the Torula is acknowledged to be one of the
  Fungals, and the chemical constituents of the Fungi approach very nearly
  that of animal tissues. They contain a peculiar principle, residing in
  and obtainable from them, termed Fungin, which is as highly azotised as
  animal fibre. The protein compound alluded to, Mulder says, is not
  gluten, because insoluble in boiling alcohol, and not albumen, because it
  is very readily dissolved in acetic acid, and he regards it as a
  superoxide of protein. This superoxide of protein can only have been
  produced by a vital action in the cells of the Torula, and as the fungi
  consume oxygen, and give out carbonic acid, we clearly have all the
  elementary conditions for their growth in almost all decomposing animal
  and vegetable matters. It is the nature of the fungi to live on organized
  matter, but always when it has a tendency to decay; it is for this reason
  they have been called "Scavengers." Again, we can understand why some
  animalized or nitrogenous matter should be necessary for fermentation,
  otherwise fungi could not grow, nitrogen being an essential constituent
  of <!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page114"></a>{114}</span>their structure, and further fermentation
  does not commence without the presence of oxygen, and like as in animals,
  this gas supports their existence. The conversion of sugar into alcohol
  is represented by the following formula:&mdash;</p>

  <p>If therefore the process were merely of a chemical nature, where is
  the necessity for atmospheric oxygen to accomplish the end? it is quite
  certain that fermentation cannot go on without its presence. Let us
  compare the action of ferment or yeast in a dried state to the action of
  albumen, which Liebig says is sufficient when decomposing to set up
  fermentation. "The white of eggs when added to saccharine liquors
  requires a period of three weeks, with a temperature of 96° F. before it
  will excite fermentation."<a name="NtA42"
  href="#Nt42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> But any saccharine liquor on exposure to
  the air, though entirely destitute of albumen or gluten, will ferment,
  and the Torula may be found in it. I have found the Torula in a great
  variety of syrups which have spontaneously undergone fermentation. I have
  also discovered that the development of the cells is delayed or
  accelerated by the nature of the ingredient used in flavouring <!-- Page
  115 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page115"></a>{115}</span>the
  syrups, with other peculiarities which need not here be mentioned.</p>

  <p>But the conversion of starch into sugar by means of gluten requires
  some notice, as by some persons it is associated in their minds with the
  organic process of fermentation.<a name="NtA43"
  href="#Nt43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> Mulder ascribes the latter in the first
  instance to the action of heat, evidently believing that the
  pseudo-catalytic operation of gluten upon starch is the type of all such
  actions, and regarding them all as simply chemical, but we here
  distinguish a wide difference; in the latter instance the gluten is
  decomposed, and rendered unfit for a repetition of the chemical
  phenomenon, and if it is desired to renew the action fresh gluten must be
  obtained, and a certain temperature kept up, otherwise the experiment
  fails. How different is fermentation: in the ordinary temperature of the
  atmosphere the yeast vesicle will multiply, no incremental or unnatural
  addition of heat is requisite, and it is one of the commonest and most
  natural instances of vegeto-chemistry: the grape cannot shed its juice,
  nor the sugar cane its sap without admitting these germs, which, under
  certain <!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page116"></a>{116}</span>conditions multiply themselves and convert
  the saccharine elements into new compounds. The method by which the
  conversion of starch into sugar is accomplished is thus described by Dr.
  Ure. He says that if starch one part be boiled with twelve parts of water
  and left to itself, water merely being stirred in it as it evaporates, at
  the end of a month or two in summer weather it is changed into sugar and
  gum, bearing certain proportions to the amount of starch used. But "if we
  boil two parts of potato starch into a paste, with twenty parts of water,
  mix this paste with one part of the gluten of wheat flour, and set the
  mixture for eight hours in a temperature of from 122° to 167° F. the
  mixture soon loses its pasty character, and becomes by degrees limpid,
  transparent, and sweet, passing at the same time first into gum and then
  into sugar."&mdash;"The residue has lost the faculty of acting upon fresh
  portions of starch."</p>

  <p>Four points of contrast present themselves for notice as elements of
  comparison with true fermentation. 1st. The starch solution has to be
  boiled, so that heat, by which it is to be supposed that the starch
  globule is ruptured, seems to be an essential portion of the chemical
  change, and even this may in fact alone be sufficient in such a case to
  produce some elementary change in the starch, and may prepare it for the
  subsequent catalytic action of some related organic, though not vital
  material.<a name="NtA44" href="#Nt44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> <!-- Page 117
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>{117}</span>2nd. Not only
  a summer heat is necessary, but a period of one or two months time must
  elapse before the starch with the water simply becomes converted into
  sugar, and if artificial heat is to be used to hasten the operation, a
  temperature from 122° to 167° F. must be resorted to in order to obtain
  the desired result. 3rd. When even this is accomplished there is no
  reproduction of the fermenting matter, and artificial and chemical means
  must again be applied to repeat the experiment. 4th. The conversion of
  starch into sugar can be accomplished without the presence of gluten at
  all, by the aid only of temperature and time. It seems to me, therefore,
  to be entirely unnecessary to occupy more space in the elaboration of a
  proof of the doctrine that the germs of the Torula are the sole agents in
  the conversion of saccharine fluids into alcohol and carbonic acid. By
  another chemical process starch can be converted into sugar, but I am not
  aware that hitherto any method has been discovered by which sugar can be
  converted into alcohol except by the process of fermentation proper.</p>

  <p>I have been thus particular in commenting on this subject, as it
  bears, in an especial manner, on the question under consideration.</p>

<p><!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"></a>{118}</span></p>

  <p>The physiologist cannot afford to lose this process from the category
  of chemico-vital, or biochemical manifestations.<a name="NtA45"
  href="#Nt45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> The philosophy of the age has a tendency
  to make every thing chemical; it is true that the Divinity is as much
  seen in the laws which govern the elementary particles of matter, as in
  those laws which preside over the transmutation and sustentation of those
  elementary and inorganic particles, when compounded in the tissues which
  are engaged in the formation of living beings. The laws by which acids
  and alkalies neutralize each other, and the affinities single, double and
  elective, which the particles of matter exhibit, together with the
  influences of light, heat, and electricity upon almost every condition of
  matter, are as truly wonderful as the creative power. Man may, in many
  instances, imitate the processes of nature, he can render iron magnetic,
  and form alkaloids, but the <!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page119"></a>{119}</span>laws which govern the particles of matter
  are still the secret of the whole proceedings. We do but interpret the
  language of nature in discovery, the book is ever open before us, and
  every atom of the world is a word and a theme, capable of occupying the
  short span of sublunary existence allotted to man. We have read of
  "sermons in stones," but a book has been written on a "pebble."<a
  name="NtA46" href="#Nt46"><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

  <p>To return, as we every where in nature find a gradual transition in
  the forms, arrangements and properties of matter, so we may expect to
  find a link between the inorganic and vital chemistry of nature. The
  fungi, by which we contend this transition appears to be accomplished,
  are also a link in chemical composition, between the animal and vegetable
  kingdom, and not only in that, but in their subsisting upon matter which
  has been organized, they are deoxidizers and reducers, as the vegetable
  kingdom in its highest function is a compounder. To their functions and
  offices in the great scheme of creation, we may fairly apply ourselves
  with a sure and certain result of the most interesting discovery. Is it
  no hint that wherever decaying organic matter is found, there do we find
  fungi? is it no hint that they are found in all parts of the world? that
  even in snow the germs of fungi will grow and multiply to such an extent,
  according to Capt. Ross, that the protococcus was seen <!-- Page 120
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page120"></a>{120}</span>by him,
  clothing the sides of the mountains at Baffin's Bay, rising, according to
  his report, to the height of several <i>hundred feet</i>, and extending
  to the distance of <i>eight miles</i>?</p>

  <p>Even stones contain in their interior, or interspaces of their
  structure, the germs of fungi. A species of Tufa is found in the vicinity
  of Naples of a porous texture, which, when moistened and shaded, produces
  vast mushrooms, four or five inches high, and eight or ten inches
  broad.<a name="NtA47" href="#Nt47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> This author
  further says: "In the Maremma, where the volcanic tufa is the basis of
  the soil the surface is intermixed with the animal remains of departed
  empires, and the ordure of cattle, is covered with grasses of old
  pasturages, and is wet with heavy dews. Everything, therefore, conspires
  there to a fungiferous end."</p>

  <p>They are found growing in and upon both vegetables and animals. Nees
  von Esenbeck imagined, that minute forms multiplied themselves in the
  atmosphere; and really, when we consider the amount of effluvia composed
  of the atoms cast off from the bodies of living or decaying organic
  matters, which are incessantly passing into the atmosphere, the
  conjecture is not an unreasonable one. The minuteness of those, which we
  know are always found growing on decomposing bodies, does not preclude
  the possibility, nay, further favours <!-- Page 121 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page121"></a>{121}</span>the probability, that
  others infinitely more minute,<a name="NtA48"
  href="#Nt48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> may be destined to remove the more
  subtle and vaporous particles which escape into the air.</p>

  <p>We can, therefore, I think, conclude, that the lower tribes of
  vegetation, may consistently be regarded as capable of existing in almost
  any condition, and almost under any circumstances, they may be made to
  grow in plants by inoculation, as shewn by De Candolle, and Dr. Hassall.
  If the stem of wheat also is inoculated with vibriones, they will make
  their appearance in the grain.<a name="NtA49"
  href="#Nt49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> If the seed contain them and have not
  lost its germinating properties, these worms will be found again in the
  grain. If the grain containing them be dried for years, and moistened
  again with water, these animalcules, according to Bauer and Steinbach,
  will present all the phenomena of life. This experiment I have witnessed,
  and can confirm the statement. These animalcules in the diseased grain,
  have under the microscope the appearance of an immense <!-- Page 122
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>{122}</span>number of eels
  crowded together in a small space, and presenting a movement more,
  perhaps, vermicular than any other, and it is continued for a
  considerable time. Now if these animalcules, or their ova, can be proved
  to pass with the sap to the seed, there can be no difficulty in
  comprehending how germs, considerably more minute and of a vegetable
  nature, should be found subject to the same peculiar mode of obtaining an
  entrance into animals and vegetables for sustenance. "It is usually
  imagined," says Dr. Carpenter, "that the germs liberated by one plant are
  taken up by the roots of others, and being carried along the current of
  the sap, are deposited and developed, where vegetation is most
  active."</p>

  <p>The chemical theory of disease would be better sustained by a
  comparison of "the artificial formation of alkaloids," and the phenomena
  of transformation of blood into the tissues of animals, and their
  degeneration into effete matters, and of sap into the tissues of plants
  and their degenerations.</p>

  <p>Professor Kopp of Strasburg, says, "In a chemical point of view, the
  alkaloids are remarkable for their composition, for their special
  properties, both physical and chemical, and for the interesting reactions
  to which many of them give rise, when exposed to the influence of
  different reagents. Considered medically, the organic bases are
  distinguished by their energetic properties. They <!-- Page 123 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page123"></a>{123}</span>constitute at the same
  time, the most violent and sudden poisons, and the most valuable and
  heroic remedies."</p>

  <p>Upon this very intricate and interesting part of chemical philosophy,
  it is rather dangerous to enter without a thorough and practical
  knowledge of the subject. This, however, falls to the lot of few men. We,
  who are engaged in the study of disease, and of the best methods of cure,
  are obliged to take the investigations of the analytical chemist, and
  examine them for ourselves in the intervals of leisure allowed us during
  the active exercise of our calling. Though with less advantages for the
  study of these transcendental relations of organic and inorganic matter,
  we are not, nevertheless, precluded from forming our opinions on their
  practical bearings to the phenomena and treatment of disease.</p>

  <p>That there is a matter of a poisonous nature concerned in the
  production of endemic and epidemic affections, cannot be doubted by any
  one; I believe indeed, that the chemical theorists admit this, at all
  events Liebig does, for he says, "The morbid poison changes in the blood
  are fermentative, just such as occur in beer making." If we start, then,
  with the consideration that poisons, in a chemical point of view, are the
  objects of our research; the obvious course to take is to enquire what is
  the source of poisons generally, and what their effects on the animal
  economy? The mineral poisons are entirely excluded from the enquiry by
  their <!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page124"></a>{124}</span>inaptitude for diffusion, and their
  uniform effects upon all persons, differing only in degree in their
  operation. The same objections apply to gaseous poisons, except that to
  them the property of diffusion would be admitted.<a name="NtA50"
  href="#Nt50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> We come then to the alkaloids, which
  constitute, as Kopp says, the most violent and sudden poisons. For the
  production of alkaloids by artificial means, organic products of some
  kind are required. Artificial heat, powerful chemical agents or length of
  time, are, as far as information at present extends, the indispensable
  requirements to induce these peculiar changes in matter. The only
  instance I can find, in which elementary matters can by artificial means
  be combined, so as to resemble the products of nature, is that of the
  conversion of carbon and nitrogen into cyanogen. But the process by which
  this is accomplished, leads rather to doubt whether it be really and
  simply by a combination of <i>elementary</i> carbon and nitrogen. I
  extract the following from the Annual Report of the Progress of
  Chemistry, for 1848. "H. Delbruck has performed some experiments on the
  important subject of the formation of cyanogen. He confirms the
  statements of Desfosses and Fownes, inasmuch as a <i>weak but
  distinct</i> formation of cyanogen was observed on igniting <!-- Page 125
  --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page125"></a>{125}</span><i>sugar-charcoal</i><a name="NtA51"
  href="#Nt51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> with carbonate of potassa in an
  atmosphere of nitrogen." The use of sugar-charcoal, may be perhaps an
  explanation of the weak formation of cyanogen, for in these numerous and
  successive chemical changes of matter, it is impossible to say how many
  sources of error may arise. The constant contradictions of each other,
  and the opposite statements made by chemists, of equal eminence, leave us
  in a wilderness of doubt, from which we are not likely to be freed, until
  definite laws shall be discovered to act as a guide in the comprehension
  of the higher branches of Chemical Philosophy.</p>

  <p>But supposing that the generation of alkaloids could take place in the
  body, or some analogous poisonous matter, we have yet to imagine a whole
  host of peculiar and essential conditions to effect this change, besides
  an atmospheric agent or agents to set in motion those compositions and
  decompositions, capable of bringing out these new products from the
  elements of blood. We are aware that in the blood, carbon and nitrogen
  are sufficiently abundant as well as saline compounds, to generate
  cyanides, and, with hydrogen also there in plenty, hydrocyanates, and
  thus from them many other poisonous products, but how is all this to be
  effected? And even if effected, it is yet a question if such compounds
  can in any way simulate the attacks of epidemic disease. We have <!--
  Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page126"></a>{126}</span>already shewn that the amount of most
  poisons necessary to destroy an individual, can be pretty clearly
  estimated, and their <i>modus operandi</i> is tolerably well understood.
  Again, the most essential part, in which all chemical theory fails, is an
  explanation of the reproduction of contagious matter.</p>

  <p>The catalytic process, by which decompositions are said to be
  effected, and in which Liebig includes the various fermentations, is one
  of those chemical relations of matter to matter, considered by some as
  the probable cause of infection. Mr. Simon, in a late lecture, has said,
  "I consider the phenomena of infective diseases, to be essentially
  chemical, and I look to chemistry to enlighten the darkness of their
  pathology. Qualitative modifications, affecting the molecules of matter
  as to their modes of action and reaction, are such as form the subject of
  chemical science; and those humoral changes which arise as the result of
  infection clearly fall within the terms of its definitions." Further on
  he adds: "The phenomena of infected diseases appears then, in many
  respects, to be sui generis. Certainly they are chemical. <i>Probably</i>
  they belong to that <i>class</i> of chemical actions called
  <i>catalytic</i>."<a name="NtA52" href="#Nt52"><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 127 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page127"></a>{127}</span></p>

  <p>It is not improbable that something resembling a catalytic action may
  take place in the blood in those diseases of endemic and epidemic origin,
  but that it can be by a chemical process alone is contrary to all
  experience of catalytic operations, for except in the instance of
  fermentation proper, there is no multiplication of the fermentative
  matter. The action of the matter of contagion seems to stand on the
  confines between electro-chemical and bio-chemical manifestations, and so
  long as no chemical explanation can be given for the multiplication of
  the matter of infection, the most rational course to adopt is to assume
  that life under some unknown form is, as we every where find it, the sole
  reproductive agent.</p>

<p class="cenhead">SECTION II.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE ANIMALCULAR THEORY OF EPIDEMICS UNTENABLE.</span></p>

  <p>The animalcular theory of disease, after remaining almost unnoticed
  for nearly two centuries, has been again revived under the auspices of
  Dr. Holland in this country, and Henle of Berlin. And though not entirely
  buried in obscurity, this theory had completely failed to modify the
  practice of physicians in the treatment of those diseases which were
  supposed to owe their existence to these invisible atoms of created
  being. The resuscitated notions and all their amplifications, to which
  the advance of science has contributed so much, are threatened with a
  like fate, an absence of all practical results.</p>

  <p>Though I would not attempt to deny the possibility, nay, even the
  probability, that insect life may yet be discovered as the cause of some
  diseases,<a name="NtA53" href="#Nt53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> still <!-- Page
  129 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129"></a>{129}</span>there are
  many and cogent reasons against both, and which are at variance with
  facts and observations. Where insect life has been found associated with
  disease, it more especially appears as a consequence than as a cause.</p>

  <p>Disease, in its most enlarged sense, is a conversion of one form of
  matter into another; it is a transformation of healthy blood and tissue
  into new and abnormal products. Where insects in all their variety of
  forms are discovered, their voracious propensities are their chief
  characteristics, they are the consumers of matter after its partial
  disintegration, if animal matter be their food, unless they be
  carnivorous and predacious, or if herbivorous they usually feed upon the
  tender shoots of plants. Thus far we are certain of the manner in which
  insects destroy living matter; it is a process the unassisted eye may
  every where witness, and which experience has amply attested. To take,
  however, the animalcular world as it presents itself to us under the
  microscope, and as the intermediate step between the manifest and the
  hidden for a fairer and more direct method of reaching the truth, what do
  we observe to be the ruling law of infusory instinct? They live to feed;
  the term polygastrica sufficiently implies their natural tendency to
  consume. The simplest form of animalcular life, seen in the genera of
  monads, still preserves the animal character by possessing a stomach or
  stomachs in which the food is received, to be digested for the
  nourishment of the <!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page130"></a>{130}</span>system; and even some of these minute
  objects which vary in size from one <i>two-thousandth</i>, to one
  <i>three-thousandth</i> of a line in diameter, are said to be carnivorous
  and predacious. Upon this fact alone, I would place the improbability of
  insects being the cause of epidemic disease. Each insect doubtless has
  its own peculiar food, and whether it be a vegetable or animal feeder, it
  consumes the matter already organized for conversion into its own tissue,
  and the only change which could be affected by them in the blood, would
  necessarily be that of appropriation of some one of the constituents as
  an element of food; when that food is digested, (taking digestion
  generally as an identical process,) the excrementitious matter is
  composed of secretions and disorganized matter, mixed together as an
  <i>effete</i> product, and destined then for reorganization by the
  vegetable kingdom. Now all animals, whether they be large or small, live
  on organized matter,&mdash;they convert that matter into an inorganic
  form, and I cannot help imagining that if epidemic diseases and fevers
  depended upon animalcular growth and development in the blood or tissues
  of the body, the excretions or secretions from them would have yielded
  some information to the searching enquiries of the chemist, supposing
  that these excretions and secretions were capable of reaching to a
  sufficient amount in quantity, to bring about those fatal effects of
  poisoning, we witness in Cholera and other epidemic affections. Insects,
  I <!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page131"></a>{131}</span>believe are poisonous only by their
  secretions, and though they are known to multiply with exceeding
  rapidity, I can hardly imagine that by their development, however rapid,
  they could produce such a change in the human body, as to bring about the
  speedy dissolution, and generally gangrenous appearance, that has
  invariably been observed in those suddenly dying under the influence of
  epidemic poisons. The vibriones, whose destructive effects on wheat are
  so well known, are a genus of animalcules, which at first would seem to
  favour the animalcular theory in a remarkable manner; for on examining
  them, they do not appear to possess any other structure than a gelatinous
  absorbing mass, in this respect resembling a vegetable.</p>

  <p>But Ehrenberg's scrutiny corrected the error of De Blanville, and
  shewed, that they were far from being agastria, or stomachless animals.
  The Rev. William Kirby says, "Ehrenberg has studied the vibriones in
  almost every climate, and has discovered, by keeping them in coloured
  waters, that they are not the simple animals that Lamarck and others
  supposed, and that almost all have a mouth and digestive organs, and that
  numbers of them have many stomachs." All the discoveries indeed which
  have been made on the minuter forms of animal life, have tended to
  confirm the doctrine that the stomach is the exponent organ of an animal;
  that is, in all animals there exists, in a variety of modified
  conditions, a receptacle for food. Some of the <!-- Page 132 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>{132}</span>animalcules, however,
  are still supposed to exist by absorption, as the vinegar eel, <i>vibrio
  anguilla</i>,<a name="NtA54" href="#Nt54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> but when we
  find that the law is, generally speaking, that the receptacles of food
  become multiplied in number in these minute beings, and the vibriones
  which were supposed to be stomachless, have been proved to emulate their
  associates in the number of these organs; it would be more reasonable to
  conclude that our imperfect vision is the barrier to their detection,
  rather than to suppose that they do not exist. Besides, when we are told
  on undoubted authority that some of the animals of this class, have as
  many as <i>forty or fifty</i> stomachs; the least we can do, is to allow
  that all of them possess, at least one digestive organ, though we may not
  be able to detect it.<a name="NtA55" href="#Nt55"><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

  <p>So far then for the consideration of animalcular structure: let us now
  more particularly enquire into their destructive habits, and their
  functions, inasmuch <!-- Page 133 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page133"></a>{133}</span>as they may be supposed capable of
  engendering epidemic diseases and fever. The truly carnivorous
  animalcules, or those truly herbivorous in their instincts, we may
  presume to be beyond the limits of our enquiry. We have rather to do with
  those which take an intermediate position, namely, those which feed upon
  matter undergoing decomposition, or upon fluids containing organic
  matters in solution, or suspension. If we take Entozoa generally, they
  may be considered as most conveniently to be placed in this intermediate
  class; and here we find still the digestive apparatus, and more than
  this,&mdash;for upon the modifications of the organs appropriated to
  digestion is their classification founded. "Rudolphi divided the Entozoa
  into Sterelmintha, or those in which the nutrient tubes without anal
  outlet are simply excavated in the general parenchyma, and into the
  C&oelig;lelmintha, in which an intestinal canal with proper parietes
  floats in a distinct abdominal cavity, and has a separate outlet for the
  excrements."<a name="NtA56" href="#Nt56"><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

  <p>How do these animals obtain their sustenance, and what changes can
  they produce upon the vital fluid of the body? Analogy is here our only
  guide. If the trichina spiralis is examined, it is found to be enclosed
  in a cyst containing fluid; and this is, <!-- Page 134 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page134"></a>{134}</span>doubtless, the source
  of its nutriment, and contains in solution the elements for its
  nutrition; but in this instance there is no selection, and there can be
  no locomotion to an extent sufficient to imply searching for food, as the
  animalcule in its natural state, when taken from the human muscle, is
  found coiled upon itself, making about two and a half turns. The fluid of
  the cyst is thus in all likelihood prepared by endosmosis, for the
  immediate and appropriate nutrition of the parasite. The cyst is thus the
  part which performs the diseased process, the containing animalcule is
  merely the consumer of what is prepared for it by the cyst. And this
  would seem to be the rule with all parasites, of the encysted kind.</p>

  <p>We have alluded to the vibriones which are found in the fluids of
  living bodies, and the trichina which is found in the solid muscle; we
  have now to refer to those which infest the cavities. It was, I believe,
  Ehrenberg, who shewed that the tartar which accumulates on the teeth is
  composed of the debris of minute animalcules; in fact, that it consists
  of calcareous matter, having once formed a portion of the structure of
  their bodies, the ubiquity of these creatures is therefore as much and
  clearly established as the lower forms of vegetation. The intestinal
  worms, of which perhaps the Tænia is the most curious and important to be
  noticed, are from the locality in which they are found, chiefly injurious
  by the irritation they set up, and by appropriating <!-- Page 135
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135"></a>{135}</span>to themselves
  the nutrient juices elaborated in the process of animal digestion, thus
  depriving the individuals they infest of that which was destined for
  their own nourishment. In this, as in all associated instances, the
  character by which these parasitic animals are marked is their consuming
  propensity. There is, however, one more observation to make upon
  parasitic growths; but the question is yet unsettled in what kingdom of
  nature is the acephalocyst, or hydatid, to be placed. Mr. Owen says, "As
  the best observers agree in stating, that the acephalocyst is impassive
  under the application of stimuli of any kind, and manifests no
  contractile power, either partial or general, save such as results from
  elasticity, in short, neither feels nor moves, it cannot, as the animal
  kingdom is at present characterized, be referred to that division of
  organic nature."</p>

  <p>We thus arrive at the simple cell, and the multiplication of living
  beings by cell buds; it is the point at which the confines of the animal
  kingdom are reached, and at which we are driven to speculation. The
  hydatid lives like a plant, by imbibition; and procreates, like a plant,
  by budding, either endogenously or exogenously, as regards the original
  or parent cell.<a name="NtA57" href="#Nt57"><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 136 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136"></a>{136}</span></p>

  <p>This condition of being, suggested the notion of Protozoa, or first
  animals, in the same way that the purely cellular plants, that is, each
  individual, consisting of a single cell, gave the idea of <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads 'Prolophyta'."
  >Protophyta</span>, or first plants. Mr. Kirby thus expresses himself on
  this subject: "The first plants, and the first animals, are scarcely more
  than animated molecules, and appear analogues of each other; and those
  above them in each kingdom represent jointed fibrils."</p>

  <p>Admitting, then, that animals as well as plants exist in the form of
  simple cells, and that their multiplication proceeds apparently upon the
  same principle in each, it is nevertheless abundantly manifest, that the
  cellular form of perfect individuals is infinitely more numerous in the
  vegetable than in the animal kingdom.</p>

<p><!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"></a>{137}</span></p>

  <p>From the mosses downwards to the fungi, the whole structure of the
  plants consists of an aggregation of cells, more or less in number and
  complicate arrangement, until, through a variety of gradations, we reach
  the single cell as a perfect individual.</p>

  <p>It is rather remarkable, that the lower forms of vegetables and
  animals seem to derive their nutriment from matter of a similar kind; and
  though the office of plants is as a rule, to convert inorganic into
  organized matter, it appears that some of the fungi may live as animals
  do on organic matter when in a state of solution. This, however, is
  uncertain; for we do not know what are the first signs of decomposition
  in organized bodies, and for aught we can tell, it may be perpetually
  going on; so far as the disengagement of carbon from the system is
  concerned, this is certain; but whether the nitrogenous compounds also
  are subject to a resolution into their elements in the living body, is
  another question, and not so easy of solution. The partially decomposed
  elements of animal structures are, however, particularly adapted for the
  nutrition of the lower forms of vegetation; it is, indeed, from the
  decaying organic matters that the fungi derive, it may be said, their
  entire food.</p>

<p class="cenhead">SECTION III.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">SKETCH OF THE PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS.</span></p>

  <p>Animals and plants depend for their existence upon a nutritive fluid,
  which permeates their structure; it is the element from which all their
  secretions are formed, and their organs are nourished.</p>

  <p>The food of animals is composed of previously organized matters, and
  is conveyed into a reservoir called a stomach, where it undergoes a
  process of solution, previously to entering the circulation. At this
  period, the animal and the plant again present points of resemblance, the
  lymphatics or absorbent vessels take up the products of digestion, and
  convey them to the blood-vessels, where mingling with the current of the
  blood, they are conveyed to the lungs, there to undergo a process of
  oxygenation before they become fitted for the renovation of the tissues
  of the body. Such is the nature of the food of man, that it contains all
  the elements necessary and adapted for transformation into bone, muscle,
  brain, and parenchyma, as well as the other tissues of the body; besides
  other elementary matters, which, though they form a very insignificant
  portion of <!-- Page 139 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page139"></a>{139}</span>animal textures, from their constant
  presence in the vital fluid, evidently perform some important offices in
  the general economy of life; they are partly, perhaps, occupied in
  forming constituents of secretions.</p>

  <p>Plants do not require a stomach,&mdash;the humus or soil to which they
  are fixed is the laboratory, where the nutritive matter is prepared in a
  state fit for absorption by the spongioles of their roots, and these
  correspond to the lymphatics of animals; after being taken up by the
  spongioles, this new fluid mingles with the sap, and passes to the leaves
  or breathing apparatus of plants, where carbonic acid gas combines with
  the crude vital liquid, and converts it into a condition fit for all the
  offices to be performed by the plant: viz. the growth of tissues, and the
  elaboration of secretions.</p>

  <p>The tissues, however, of plants, though more simple in their nature,
  present a much more varied character than those of animals, when the
  different species are compared.</p>

  <p>The bones of animals which give them their form, are invariably
  constituted of phosphate and carbonate of lime, deposited in a matrix of
  gluten; muscle, nerve, brain, tendons, and ligaments, have nearly, if not
  completely, an identical composition throughout the whole range of the
  animal kingdom: their secretions, however, vary much more considerably,
  as also do the secretions of vegetables. But vegetable tissue may
  contain, as in the stems of <!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page140"></a>{140}</span>grasses, a considerable amount of silex,
  and some notable quantity of sulphur, and so essential to their existence
  is the former element, that they cannot live without its presence in the
  soil, and also with it an alkali, to render it soluble. A large amount of
  soda, is an invariable attendant upon the structure of marine plants, as
  potash is of those growing on the land.</p>

  <p>Thus, whether we regard the health of animals, or vegetables, we
  discover, that besides the matters which are absolutely indispensable for
  the nutriment of the tissues which undergo rapid transformation, those of
  a more permanent and durable nature require in an almost insensible
  degree, a restitution of elements; and though not apparently absolutely
  necessary to preserve vitality in the being, yet have so marked an
  influence over it, as to indicate an extensive bearing of each <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads 'indivdual'.">individual</span>
  part, on the whole associated entity.</p>

  <p>The elementary tissues of both kingdoms have been traced, in whatever
  form they may be found, to a cellular origin. The minutest vegetable
  germ, is a cell containing a granular matter within it, and even man
  himself, in his embryonic state, may be represented as an insignificant
  point in the realms of space; and might be placed side by side with the
  smallest particle of living matter, without suffering by the
  comparison.</p>

  <p>The laws by which the development of these elementary cells is
  regulated, so that each advances <!-- Page 141 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page141"></a>{141}</span>to its limit, and
  fulfils its destination, is one of those inscrutable and overwhelming
  mysteries of nature, which leads the admirer of creation on and on into
  the abyss of the future, and fills his soul with aspirations for that
  time, when the veil of ignorance shall be withdrawn. But this is not my
  subject.</p>

  <p>The organization of the two animated kingdoms, is then regulated by
  definite laws, and all matter, whether acting upon them as agents of
  nutrition or destruction, are equally under their dominion; to
  investigate and to endeavour to fathom some of these laws, is the aim I
  have in view.</p>

  <p>The sap is to the plant, what the blood is to the animal,&mdash;the
  elements of nutrition and secretion are contained in it, and whatever
  interferes with its normal constitution by subtracting from, or adding to
  it, deteriorates its qualities, and retards or accelerates the functions
  of the individual. Excess or deficiency of the natural elements may also
  be a source of disturbance; if carbonic acid be too abundantly liberated
  in the soil, as Dr. Lindley expresses it, "plants become gorged;" and if,
  on the other hand, the elimination be too slow, they become starved. It
  has been also shewn, that plants though they give out oxygen from their
  leaves, do not throw it off as animals do carbonic acid from their lungs;
  but that this arises as a result of digestion, and the fixation of carbon
  in the system, and that they really respire oxygen as <!-- Page 142
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page142"></a>{142}</span>animals do,
  and give off carbonic acid, both by day and night.</p>

  <p>That light is the stimulant of the digestive functions, and that,
  therefore, during the day, the amount of oxygen thrown off, far exceeds
  the amount of carbonic acid liberated during the same period.</p>

  <p>The great and important distinction between animals and plants is,
  that the former possess a nervous system, by which they are subject to a
  very extended series of psychological relations; it is in these chiefly,
  if not entirely, that we are to look for the distinctive and well-marked
  differences of diseased action. In animals there are special media of
  communication between the sources of dynamic power, and the parts upon
  which the force is exercised: and again, a return communication exists,
  which conveys impressions to the source of power, and to use a simple
  comparison, a system of telegraphing is in incessant and watchful
  operation. This force is influenced and modified in its action, when
  exercised in the regulation of nutrition, growth, and reproduction of
  tissues, by the passions and emotions of the mind. All the secretions and
  functions of the body are more or less susceptible of being accelerated,
  retarded or modified by the psychical relations of mind and matter.
  Though we are apt to imagine that in man alone, these phenomena obtain
  much importance&mdash;there can be but little doubt, that wherever a <!--
  Page 143 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page143"></a>{143}</span>nervous system exists, whether in the form
  of aggregated or diffused ganglia, the interdependence of force and
  organization, each upon the other, bears a certain and definite
  physiological comparison; the more aggregated the ganglia, the more
  close, intimate, and extensive the psychical connexions, and the
  gradations pass downwards, until they appear to be lost on the confines
  of the vegetable kingdom.</p>

  <p>The diseases of plants and animals deserve a more careful comparison
  than, I think, has hitherto been bestowed upon them.<a name="NtA58"
  href="#Nt58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> If the study of physiology, or an
  enquiry into the laws which regulate the functions of living beings in a
  state of health, has been materially aided by the intimate knowledge of
  vegetable physiology, which, from the simple structure of plants, so
  favours the experiments of the student, there is every reason to suppose
  that vegetable pathology may also lead us to an equally important and
  useful result.</p>

  <p>It is quite certain, that if a healthy seed, or leaf-bud, be placed in
  such a situation, that, according to the laws known, it will in all
  likelihood germinate, if all the elements for its sustenance exist in the
  soil, and the temperature and hygrometric <!-- Page 144 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page144"></a>{144}</span>condition of the
  atmosphere are adapted to it, a healthy plant will be the result. Light,
  heat, moisture, and soil are therefore to be considered as the agents
  required to exist in a certain balance, or proportion, in reference to
  the health or power of vitality of the plant. Within a certain amount of
  variation, health may persist in virtue of the power of selection, which
  appertains to the spongioles of the root in absorbing nutriment; and also
  as regards light, from the tendency which most plants have to accommodate
  themselves to any deficiency of this element, by presenting their leafy
  expansion in that direction where the most of its influence may be
  obtained. But beyond a certain limit an unhealthy condition sets in. If
  the soil contain not the inorganic elements, which are absolutely
  indispensable for the tissues of the plant, or even if they be there and
  not in a state to be absorbed, a dwindling and degeneration ensue; if
  light be deficient in quantity, pallor, feebleness, and elongation of
  tissue follow, with more fluidity and general softness of texture. These
  conditions of plants have their analogues in the ill-fed and
  ill-nourished children in some of our manufacturing districts; they are
  stunted and diseased. Transport a healthy country lad, with the bloom of
  health on his cheek, from his native hills and valleys, or woods and
  fields, to the stool behind a desk for eight hours a day, in a narrow
  street in any city, where the rays of the sun rarely penetrate, it will
  not be long before <!-- Page 145 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page145"></a>{145}</span>the skin of the animal and the cuticle of
  the plant may be submitted for comparison, when both will testify to the
  importance of the solar rays, as an indispensable agent in supporting the
  normal processes of organic life. So far common observation is competent
  to a solution of the facts; but beyond this we come to the enquiry, what
  resemblances are there in the early conditions of plants and animals.
  Each originates from nucleated cells, endowed by the All-seeing Power
  with a blind impulse of progressive development; the most simple cell of
  a vegetable multiplies itself by a generation of new cells within it,
  when the parent dies, and liberates the offspring. Here progression is
  simply multiplication; it is, as it were, progression in length only. The
  original cell, however, of animals, which is styled the germinal vesicle,
  extends or becomes developed into dissimilar parts; and whatever may be
  the variety, all alike proceed from the original germ cell, and the
  <i>tout ensemble</i> of parts constitutes the one and indivisible whole;
  in this instance there is addition besides multiplication, tissues and
  organs are added in all variety, until the maximum of organic development
  is attained in the wonderful being, man.</p>

  <p>Yet how many points of resemblance are there between the vegetable
  cell and the fully developed human being, in a physiological and
  pathological point of view. There must be nourishment to sustain both;
  both require a certain amount of light <!-- Page 146 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page146"></a>{146}</span>and heat for their
  growth and increase, and are dependent upon various unknown causes for
  active and healthy existence; and when a certain time has expired, all
  alike return to a condition, in which the particles composing them are
  subject only to the dominion of the laws which preside over inorganic
  matter.</p>

  <p>But during the existence of plants and animals, we discover other
  features of comparison; plants, as well as animals, are liable to
  disease; they are subject to functional and organic affections. The
  former, among plants, are usually traceable to atmospheric vicissitudes
  or irregularities, changes of situation, &amp;c.; and in man to
  irregularities of diet, and mental and bodily excesses, as well as to
  atmospheric vicissitudes.<a name="NtA59"
  href="#Nt59"><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The organic diseases of plants and animals depend upon a repetition,
  or continuance, of functional derangement. As a consequence of this, the
  nutrition and reproduction of tissues lose their normal and definite
  character, wherefrom an indefinite and abnormal result is obtained. There
  is a limit to abnormal productions, and they are apparently <!-- Page 147
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page147"></a>{147}</span>subject to
  laws, though not yet understood. In animals, they may be either excessive
  development of natural tissue in natural localities, as obesity and fatty
  tumours; they may be natural products in unnatural situations, as fatty
  degenerations of muscular tissue; or altogether new and unnatural
  products, as tubercle and cancer.</p>

  <p>In plants, from their greater simplicity of structure, organic
  affections are perhaps entirely limited to the two first forms of animal
  organic disease; viz. to undue development of tissue in natural
  situations, and to the formation of natural tissue in parts of a plant
  where they are not usually found in a state of nature. The variety of
  excrescences seen on the stems, branches, and twigs of plants, may be
  given as instances of the former; and the conversion of stamina into
  petals, as in double flowers, as an instance of the latter.</p>

  <p>We derive our sustenance from vegetables, and they from us; they
  produce for us the soothing opiate and the deadly strychnia; we for them
  the animating ammonia, and the distortions and sterility of excessive
  culture; we engender in them, by the latter, debility, disease, and
  death; and in our turn we become their prey. All this indeed is but a
  cycle of events, that requires no learned mind to fathom, and to
  comprehend; it is a matter of every day occurrence, and, though perhaps
  not entirely unheeded, is not dwelt upon in the fulness of its bearings
  and importance. <!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page148"></a>{148}</span></p>

  <p>Let us now consider the diseases of plants, as a study progressive to
  those of man; and as their physiology has so extensively served us, we
  may possibly also find in their pathology much material for instruction;
  not that it will be attempted to shew that the same diseases affect both
  kingdoms, but that diseases, though dissimilar in effects, may have
  similar sources.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, there are not many men in this country, who need go
  further than their own gardens to find abundance of disease among their
  fruit trees and vegetables. The vine, the apple and the potato, common to
  most gardens, will furnish specimens.</p>

  <p>It is an error of a serious kind to suppose, that the parasites which
  infest plants are not essentially the cause, or, perhaps, more properly
  speaking, the elements of disease. I confine myself here to disease of
  parasitic origin, as that is the subject of which I am chiefly
  treating.</p>

  <p>That parasitic growths are the elements of disease in some instances,
  is now beyond dispute. The experiments of Mr. Hassall, detailed in Part
  II. of the Transactions of the Microscopical Society of London, are most
  conclusive; and they are of that simple nature, that any one may convince
  himself of their accuracy, by a repetition of them from the directions
  there laid down.</p>

  <p>He says, the decay is communicable at will "to any fruits of the apple
  and peach kind, no matter <!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page149"></a>{149}</span>how strong their vital energies may be, by
  the simple act of inoculation of the sound fruit with a portion of
  decayed matter, containing filaments of the fungi. We may use with
  success the sporules of such fungi; but in this case the decomposition
  does not set in so quickly; in the one case, the smaller filaments of the
  fungi have advanced several stages in their growth; while in the other,
  the sporules have yet to pass through the several stages of their
  development."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hassan, however, seems to speak doubtfully as to the mode in which
  the disease becomes naturally introduced;<a name="NtA60"
  href="#Nt60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> how the spores enter the fruit, "is not
  very clear&mdash;though probably, it is by insinuating themselves between
  the cells of which the cuticle is composed, or perhaps by means of the
  stomata, where they are present. I may here state that the experiments
  were made on fruit, while living, and attached to the tree."</p>

  <p>But why should there be a doubt as to the parts by which the sporules
  of minute fungi enter the plant, when it is clear, that not only can they
  enter <!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page150"></a>{150}</span>by the spongioles, but by the stomata of
  the leaves, and mingle with the sap. It is true, that they make their
  appearance and grow upon the leaves and the fruit; but these are the
  situations most adapted for their fructification. I have seen the spores
  of the fungi which attack the cucumber and vegetable-marrow, in the cells
  of the hairs, and even their filamentous prolongations; these appropriate
  the fluids conveyed to the cells of the hair, rupture them, and at length
  fructify.</p>

  <p>On referring to Dr. Lindley's Medical and Economic Botany, I find that
  many fungi are the active elements of disease, and in a manner which
  renders it highly improbable that they are so in any other way, than by
  obtaining an entrance to the sap of the plants. Of the microscopic fungus
  which destroys wheat, the Uredo caries of De Candolle, we find the
  habitat to be within the ovary of the corn, and that 4,000,000 may be
  contained in a grain of wheat,&mdash;now this and another fungus, the
  Lanosa nivalis, are said to destroy whole crops of corn: we cannot
  imagine that such an extensive affection, can have any other source than
  by means of the spores through the sap, seeing that bruising of the
  surface, or rupture of the cuticle of the apple, a comparatively soft
  fruit is necessary to produce the disease artificially in them; besides,
  a grain of corn containing vibriones, when grown and having fruited, the
  new fruit also contains them&mdash;now here, as this is I believe almost
  invariably the <!-- Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page151"></a>{151}</span>case, either they or their ova must be
  carried with the sap to the new germs.</p>

  <p>It is rather a remarkable fact, that these entophytes appropriate the
  nutriment destined for the plant in which they grow, they are
  consequently the means in many instances of its entire destruction,
  though only partially so in others.</p>

  <p>There are many Fungi which have this tendency. The Puccinia gramienis,
  "preys upon the juices of plants, and prevents the grain from swelling."
  The Æcidium urticæ, common on nettles, deprives the plant on which it
  grows, of the organizable matter, intended for its own nutrition. The
  Erysiphe communis, overruns and destroys peas. The Botrytis infestans,
  "attacks the leaves and stems of potatoes." The Oidium abortifaciens,
  attacks the ovaries of grasses&mdash;and the Oidium Tuckeri, "a
  formidable parasite, destroys the functions of the skin, of the parts it
  attacks." The latter has been most injurious to the vines, during the
  last two years. I have known instances in which the vines have been cut
  down, and every means taken to rid the houses of the disease; but this
  year, it has made its appearance, with all its former virulence, in the
  new shoots.</p>

  <p>This, however, is sufficient to shew that plants are liable to
  disease, depending upon parasitic growths, which affect their vital
  powers, and deprive them of their natural nutritive fluids.</p>

  <p>But somewhat similar diseases belong also to <!-- Page 152 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page152"></a>{152}</span>warm climates; in a
  letter from Cuba, dated Dec. 1843,&mdash;Mr. Bastian writes, "<i>a
  plague</i> has appeared among the orange trees&mdash;a mildew attacking
  the leaves and the blossoms, which finally dry up. It most frequently
  kills the trees. None of the orange family are exempt; lemons, limes, and
  their varieties, with the shaddock and forbidden fruit, have all
  suffered." This disease has continued without intermission, till the
  present year,&mdash;when the same gentleman writes, Feb. 20th, 1850: "The
  evil exists, although in a diminished degree, so much so, as to have
  allowed the trees to produce me 30,000 oranges again. In old times, the
  same plantations produced me 100,000."</p>

  <p>The West India sugar-canes are also liable to a disease, which the
  Rev. Mr. Griffiths, in his Natural History of the Island of Barbadoes,
  speaks of, in the following manner: "This, among diseases peculiar to
  canes, as among those which happen to men, too justly claims the horrible
  precedence." This disease is called the Yellow Blast. It is difficult to
  distinguish the Blast in its infancy, from the effect of dry weather.</p>

  <p>There are often seen on such sickly canes, many small protuberant
  knobs, of a soft downy substance. It is likewise observable, that such
  blades will be full of brownish decaying spots. The disease is very
  destructive to the canes. It is observed, that the Blast usually appears
  successively in the same fields, and often in the very same spot of land.
  <!-- Page 153 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page153"></a>{153}</span></p>

  <p>This Blast is often found far from "infected places," and the
  infection always spreads faster to the leeward, or with the wind.</p>

  <p>"<i>It is remarkable if canes</i> have been once infected with the
  Blast, although they afterwards to all appearance, seem to recover; yet
  the juice of such canes will neither afford so much sugar, nor so good of
  its kind, as if obtained from canes which were never infected."</p>

  <p>I may here allude to the circumstance, that in the island of Cuba, the
  destructive mildew is commonly called, <i>la pesta</i>.</p>

  <p>It were needless to multiply instances of other endemic and epidemic
  diseases of vegetables; they are well known by practical observers to be
  very numerous, and I believe, in most instances, depending upon fungoid
  growths. The destruction of vegetables by insects, is of a very different
  nature to that produced by the fungi; it would be as unreasonable to
  consider the consumption of corn and herbage by locusts, as a disease of
  vegetation, as the massacre and devouring of human beings by cannibals, a
  disease of the human body.</p>

  <p>It is true that insects are exceedingly destructive to plants, but as
  far as I am able to obtain information, they appear to be so chiefly by
  their voracious propensities; they consume the structure of the plant in
  its entity, and do not primarily interfere with its vitality. The
  instance of the vibriones, before-mentioned, seems at first to be an
  exception <!-- Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page154"></a>{154}</span>to the rule, but this is rather apparent,
  than real; and it may be made to apply more as a confirmation, than an
  obstacle to the vegetable theory: for if we may fairly compare the
  diseases of animals with those of plants, the existence of entozoa in the
  latter, would be considered an essential point to be substantiated.</p>

  <p>Having now considered the question as to the infeasibility of
  supposing that chemical fermentation is the basis upon which a theory of
  diseases can be sustained, and having shewn that life is inseparable from
  infection, and miasmatic generation;&mdash;having explained the phenomena
  of the dispersion of diseases by comparison with the dispersion of
  plants, and finally, having demonstrated that the physiology and
  pathology of plants bear so close a relation to each other, and that
  their epidemic affections depend upon minute organic germs, I submit to
  the judgment of my readers, whether there is not much reasonableness in
  the application of the facts to the inference&mdash;that living germs are
  the cause of epidemic disease in man and animals.</p>

  <p>The results obtained by comparing certain facts connected with
  Epidemic Affections of animals, with analogous affections in plants,
  afford, from the few instances I shall here notice, a very strong
  presumption, that analogous causes operate in the production of these
  affections. I have already quoted from Hecker, to shew that previously
  to, and during the Epidemics of the Middle Ages, the minuter forms of
  animal and vegetable life appeared to be called into existence, much more
  abundantly than usual; that famines prevailed in consequence of failure
  of cereal crops, no doubt depending then, as now, upon the various forms
  of fungiferous growth. I cannot refrain quoting here, a passage or two
  from our old friend Virgil; for he confirms not only the fact of peculiar

  <p>The occurrence of black showers in this country has been observed
  during the present year, and I understand that in the fenny countries of
  the East, the corn has suffered much from the Uredo. I am not mentioning
  the circumstances as cause and effect, but merely to call attention to
  the fact, that unusual phenomena of this kind have been generally
  associated with disease of the animal and vegetable tribes.</p>

  <p>The same causes also predispose plants as well as animals, to epidemic
  attacks of disease. The repeated observations in the public journals on
  the subject of ventilation, drainage, and over-crowding, render all
  notice from me needless, to shew that these, though they do not produce
  the diseases <!-- Page 157 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page157"></a>{157}</span>treated of, yet that under the influence
  of bad air, bad drainage, and over-crowding, epidemics are fostered and
  spread.</p>

  <p>Lastly, says the Count Philippo Ré, "I would remark that if <i>bad
  cultivation, and especially bad drainage, does not produce bunt or smut,
  it is certain that those fields, the worst treated in these respects,
  suffer the most from these diseases</i>."</p>

  <p>It has been remarked by many observers, that a greater fecundity has
  attended upon Pestilences, and this has been proved by comparison, that
  the births in proportion have far exceeded the ordinary limit.<a
  name="NtA62" href="#Nt62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> In juxtaposition with this
  observation, I will place the following, not as a proof, but as a remark
  made quite independently of the subject of which I am treating. "From the
  first the diseased ears are larger than the healthy ones, and are sooner
  matured. What appears singular, but which I have not, perhaps,
  sufficiently verified, is <i>that the seeds are more abundant than in a
  sound ear</i>."</p>

<p><!-- Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page158"></a>{158}</span></p>

  <p>Now these are facts which require amplification, and if these two
  alone should be shewn upon an extensive field of observation, to apply
  not only to corn, but to other members of the vegetable kingdom, as I
  doubt not will be the case, though I am not fully prepared to prove it,
  it would be difficult to dissociate the fertility of the two living
  kingdoms from the operations of one and the same, or an analogous
  law.</p>

  <p>The epidemic diseases of plants are both infectious and contagious, at
  times they are observed to be endemic only, and then depending
  particularly upon some local causes. This is a law of diseases which
  applies equally to those of men and animals. In connexion with this law
  is another, which, as far as I am aware, has not hitherto been noticed in
  connexion with plants. The potato disease, which excited so much interest
  and created so much anxiety for the poorer classes of society, led the
  Government of this country to employ the most learned men to investigate
  the subject, in the hope of propounding some reasons which should explain
  the cause of the calamity, and thereby deduce a method of eradicating the
  evil, or, in other words, discover a cure for the disease. Many were the
  opinions as to the cause of the distemper, which it were useless here to
  recount, but a method was suggested, to which most people, I believe,
  looked forward with great anticipations, and this was to obtain native
  seed, and to sow it on virgin soil. Was the end accomplished? No. <!--
  Page 159 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page159"></a>{159}</span>For
  though the seed was sown, and the plants grew, the disease still appeared
  among the newly imported individuals, to as great an extent, as among the
  native or domesticated plants.</p>

  <p>As a parallel to this, it may be stated, that, as regards either
  endemic or epidemic disease, those persons newly arrived, either in a
  district or country where these prevail, are even more liable to them
  than the residents.<a name="NtA63" href="#Nt63"><sup>[63]</sup></a>
  Again, I have learned, that where the potato disease has been so bad as
  to render the crop almost valueless, the best plan to be adopted is, to
  allow the plants to remain in the earth, and thus leave such as retain
  their germinating powers to come up spontaneously the following year. I
  certainly saw one large field treated in this way, yield a crop almost
  without disease.</p>

<p><!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page160"></a>{160}</span></p>

  <p>The seasoning, in this instance, seems to bear a comparison with the
  seasoning of animals and man, under a variety of diseases, which for a
  time renders them insusceptible of another attack. It therefore does not
  appear so improbable, that these affections may be regarded, as Unger,
  the German botanist supposed, the Exanthemata, or Eruptive Fevers of
  vegetables.</p>

  <p>Another feature seems to associate the Epidemics of plants and
  animals, in a manner suggestive of analogous causes operating in both
  instances.</p>

  <p>The lungs of animals and the leaves of vegetables, are their
  respiratory organs, by means of which, the blood in the one case and the
  sap in the other, derive gas from the air, and impart gas to it, each
  taking what is thrown off by the other.</p>

  <p>Now the epidemics among vegetables, have a remarkable tendency to
  exhibit their effects primarily on the leaves, and particularly on those
  parts which are appropriated to the function of respiration. It is from
  the stomates that many of the fungi commence to germinate, and their
  fructification may be seen sprouting from the opening composed of a
  chink, surrounded by a peculiar arrangement of cells, which constitute
  the breathing apparatus of their victim.</p>

  <p>In the earlier epidemics, of which we read, one of the most remarkable
  circumstances, was the extraordinary influence the poisonous matter
  appeared to <!-- Page 161 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page161"></a>{161}</span>exercise over the lungs,<a name="NtA64"
  href="#Nt64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> and they again, were the means of
  propagating the disease, and spreading the contagious particles through
  the atmosphere, for we read: "Thus did the plague rage in Avignon for six
  or eight weeks, and the pestilential breath of the sick, who expectorated
  blood, caused a terrible contagion far and near, for even the vicinity of
  those who had fallen ill of plague was certain death; so that parents
  abandoned their infected children, and all the ties of kindred were
  dissolved."<a name="NtA65" href="#Nt65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> "The like was
  seen in Egypt. Here also inflammation of the lungs was predominant."
  "Here too the <i>breath</i> of the sick spread a deadly contagion."</p>

  <p>It is more than probable that all infectious matter obtains an
  entrance to the system through the lungs. Inspiring the air containing
  the pestilential semina is, indeed, the only plausible explanation of
  infection; for though the skin is indubitably an absorbing <!-- Page 162
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page162"></a>{162}</span>surface, and
  capable of taking up and conveying to the blood any noxious matter
  applied to it, yet it is far more probable that the lungs would effect
  this process with greater rapidity. Then the stomach, the only other
  absorbing surface to which extraneous matter can be applied, is not
  likely to be the part where the elements of disease would obtain an
  entrance to the system, for many facts prove, that infectious matter may
  be swallowed without any injurious consequences, unless in a very
  concentrated state. Instances are not easily found of diseased matter
  having been swallowed, except where diseased vegetables have formed under
  some combination of circumstances, a portion of diet.<a name="NtA66"
  href="#Nt66"><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Many facts are on record which prove the powerful effect of diseased
  grain when made into bread, and taken for any length time as a principal
  article of food. The history of Ergot of Rye is too fresh in the memory
  of most people to require more than an allusion here. The stomach had no
  power over the secale, its poisonous properties were retained, after
  having been submitted to the digestive process, as was evidenced by the
  abortions and gangrenes it occasioned.</p>

  <p>But diseased wheat is also capable of inducing <!-- Page 163 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page163"></a>{163}</span>gangrene, and it is
  more than probable, that many diseases might be traced to the use of
  infected grain of various kinds. An interesting account of a family who
  lived at Wattisham, near Stowmarket, in Suffolk, and all of whom suffered
  more or less from living on bread made of smutty wheat, may be found in
  the Philosophical Transactions. The mother of this family and five of the
  children, consisting of three girls and two boys, all suffered from
  gangrene of the extremities; the father lost the nails from his hands,
  and had ulceration of two of his fingers.<a name="NtA67"
  href="#Nt67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> Dr. Woollaston wrote thus in a letter on
  this case: "The corn with which they made their bread was certainly very
  bad: it was wheat that had been cut in a rainy season, and had lain on
  the ground till many of the grains were black and totally decayed, but
  many other poor families in the same village made use of the same corn
  without receiving any injury from it. One man lost the use of his arm for
  some time, and still imagines himself that he was afflicted with the same
  disorder as Downing's family." It is not unlikely this was the case, for
  numbness and loss of power was one of the well marked characters of the
  disease.</p>

  <p>What other afflictions may be due to diseased vegetation and
  adulterated articles of food, and what loss of life may accrue from cheap
  and adulterated <!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page164"></a>{164}</span>drugs and chemicals is hardly yet dreamt
  of.<a name="NtA68" href="#Nt68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> The systematic
  practice of adulteration of almost every article of diet which comes to
  table has become a serious question for the legislature to consider. Take
  only the article of milk, upon which the young children of large towns
  and cities, make their chief meals, with the addition of bread. How much
  milk comes into London from the country, how much is obtained from stall
  and grain-fed cows in the metropolis, and how much is said to be
  consumed, would be an interesting calculation. It is pretty well known
  that a mixture is sold by which a retailer of milk may increase his
  supply by one-third or one-half. It was discovered in Paris that the
  brains of animals, when prepared in a particular manner, formed, when
  mixed with a certain proportion of milk and water, a very fine and
  deceptive cream; in that city this system was carried on to a
  considerable extent. I could not help alluding to these facts while
  speaking of diseased grain, for who shall say to what extent a miller in
  a large way of business, may be able to "work in," as it is called, a
  considerable amount of smutty corn in the manufacture of flour? Now, as
  diseased grain is known <!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page165"></a>{165}</span>to induce abortion, it is impossible to
  tell how small a portion may in some cases produce the effect; we may
  therefore say with Thomas of Malmesbury, "There is no action of man in
  this life which is not the beginning of so long a chain of consequences,
  as that no human providence is high enough to give us a prospect to the
  end."<a name="NtA69" href="#Nt69"><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

  <p>To return,&mdash;associated with these observations are other facts of
  considerable weight. Before and during pestilences, abortions are more
  frequent than in ordinary times; infectious and contagious diseases
  induce abortion; besides this, and independently of disease, conditions
  of the atmosphere have been known to exist when abortion has been an
  epidemic affection; of this Dr. Copland says, "to certain states of the
  atmosphere only can be attributed those frequent abortions sometimes
  observed which have even assumed an epidemic form, and of which
  Hippocrates, Fischer, Tessier, Desormeaux, and others have made mention."
  With this reference I will close the subject of comparison between the
  affections of the breathing apparatus in animals and plants, merely
  alluding to the probability that under some conditions of atmosphere,
  independently of heat, &amp;c. vegetables without any other assignable
  cause will become abortive.</p>

<p class="cenhead">SECTION II.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THOSE POISONS WHICH MOST RESEMBLE THE MORBID POISONS IN THEIR EFFECTS ON THE BODY?</span></p>

  <p>In the early part of this book, I considered the nature of poisons
  generally, and had occasion to remark upon the characters which separated
  poisons into two distinct classes. 1st, Those which have the power of
  self multiplication; and 2nd, Those destitute of this property.</p>

  <p>Of the first we have seen that the poisons of epidemic diseases
  multiply both in and out of the body.</p>

  <p>The poisons of infectious diseases, not usually epidemic, do the same.
  Those of endemic affections, such as ague and some fevers, usually become
  multiplied out of the body only, but under some circumstances, and
  peculiar atmospheric conditions, they may be also multiplied within the
  body. The amount of these poisons necessary to produce their specific
  effects, may be inappreciable. Of the second class, there are two kinds,
  those derived from the organic kingdom and those derived from the
  inorganic kingdom. Of these, the amount necessary to produce their
  specific effects is appreciable and pretty well known.</p>

  <p>But among those poisons, consisting of organic <!-- Page 167 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page167"></a>{167}</span>products, there is one
  which seems to hold an intermediate place. This is derived from one of
  the Fungals, and as it takes this remarkable position as a link of
  connexion between the two classes of poisons, I may be excused quoting a
  passage of some length upon this agent, from Dr. Lindley's Vegetable
  Kingdom. "One of the most poisonous of our fungi, is the Amanita
  muscaria, so called from its power of killing flies, when steeped in
  milk. Even this is eaten in Kamchatka, with no other than intoxicating
  effects, according to the following account by Langsdorf, as translated
  by Greville. This variety of Amanita muscaria, is used by the inhabitants
  of the north-eastern parts of Asia in the same manner as wine, brandy,
  arrack, opium, &amp;c. is by other nations."&mdash;"The most singular
  effect of the amanita is the influence it possesses over the urine. It is
  said, that from time immemorial, the inhabitants have known that the
  fungus imparts an intoxicating quality to that secretion, which
  <i>continues for a considerable time after taking it</i>. For instance, a
  man moderately intoxicated to-day, will by the next morning have slept
  himself sober, but (as is the custom) by taking a teacup of his urine, he
  will be <i>more powerfully intoxicated</i> than he was the preceding day.
  It is, therefore, not uncommon for confirmed drunkards to preserve their
  urine, as a precious liquor against a scarcity of the fungus. The
  intoxicating property of the urine <i>is capable of</i> <!-- Page 168
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page168"></a>{168}</span><i>being
  propagated</i>; for every one who partakes of it has his urine similarly
  affected. Thus with a very few amanitæ, a party of drunkards may keep up
  their debauch for a week."</p>

  <p>This property of the amanita, at once places it in a separate category
  from all other organic poisons, it has yet to be shewn upon what this
  intoxicating fungus depends for its activity. Whether some secretion is
  formed in the tissue of the plant, or whether some new arrangement of the
  particles of matter or modification of the sporules, is brought about by
  entering the system, it is impossible to say. Langsdorf states that the
  small deep-coloured specimens of amanita, and thickly covered with warts,
  are said to be more powerful than those of a larger size and paler
  colour. As the effect is not produced until from one to two hours after
  swallowing the bolus, and as a pleasant intoxication may be obtained by
  this agent for a whole day, and from one dose only, there is a defined
  line between this and the ordinary narcotics and stimulants in common
  use. That the digestive powers of the stomach have no influence over the
  intoxicating properties of the plant, is manifested in the fact, that the
  active principle passes into the urine, not only not deteriorated but
  apparently increased, for, as we have seen, a teacup of the urine from a
  man, intoxicated by taking the amanita into his stomach, will cause him
  to be more powerfully intoxicated than by the <!-- Page 169 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page169"></a>{169}</span>original dose. We have,
  therefore, but two conjectures left for consideration, either the
  original intoxicating principle is excreted from the system in a
  condensed form, in which case its indestructibility by digestion, makes
  it approach the ordinary organic poisons, or there must be an increase of
  the toxic agent, in which case we must suppose a reproductive process
  having taken place in the system. "There is," says Dr. Mitchell, "in the
  wild regions of our western country, a disease called the <i>milk
  sickness</i>, the <i>trembles</i>, the <i>tires</i>, the <i>slows</i>,
  the <i>stiff-joints</i>, the <i>puking fever</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>" The
  animals affected with this disease, "stray irregularly, apparently
  without motive;" they lose their power of attention, and finally tremble,
  stagger, and die. "When other animals&mdash;men, dogs, cats, poultry,
  crows, buzzards, and hogs, drink the milk or eat the flesh of a diseased
  cow, they suffer in a somewhat similar manner." This disease is
  attributed by Dr. Mitchell to the animals having grazed on pasture
  contaminated with mildew, and the resemblance to the effects of the
  amanita, together with the persistence of the specific principle within
  the fluids and tissues of the body, render it more than probable that to
  some fungoid growth, is due the peculiar toxic effects here noticed.
  Further: "The animals made sick by the beef of the first one, have been
  in their turn the cause of a like affection in others; so that three or
  four have thus fallen victims successively." De Graaf states, that butter
  <!-- Page 170 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page170"></a>{170}</span>made from the milk of diseased cows,
  though heated until it caught fire, did not lose its deleterious
  properties. The urine of diseased animals, collected and reduced by
  evaporation, produced the characteristic symptoms. All these facts point
  to some peculiarity in the properties of matter not yet investigated or
  at least not explained. If we may assume that reproduction is here an
  element of the persistence and apparent multiplication of active matter,
  I know only of one instance to compare with it. A gentleman about to
  deliver a lecture on the properties of arsenic, and its history
  generally, made two solutions of a given quantity of arsenious acid, in
  the following manner. He took a certain amount of distilled water, and
  the same of filtered Thames water, and made his solutions of arsenic by
  separate boilings, he then as soon as possible placed the liquids in
  identical bottles, carefully prepared for their reception. In the one
  which contained the arsenic boiled in river water, the hygrocrocis is now
  growing, while that boiled in distilled water remains perfectly limpid
  and free from any vegetable production. There can scarcely be a doubt,
  that the filtration of river water was not sufficiently purifying to
  remove the minute spores of some lower forms of vegetation, which not
  only live in arsenic but have resisted the temperature employed in
  boiling an arsenical solution to saturation.</p>

  <p>As to the first class, or truly reproductive and <!-- Page 171
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page171"></a>{171}</span>morbid
  poisons, the most heterogenous ideas have from all time existed. I have
  introduced the notice of the above poisons, viz. the Amanita, and that
  which engenders the milk sickness, to compare the results of the morbid
  poisons on the human body with them, and also to associate them with the
  effects of diseased grain. From the Amanita and that other fungoid matter
  which is said to produce the milk sickness, there appears to be a purely
  toxic action on the system, but in the instance of diseased grain, a
  blood disease, ending in gangrene, or a specific and peculiar action of
  the generative organs is the consequence, and where the latter occurs,
  the poison usually expends itself on these parts, either by inducing
  abortion, or augmenting the catamenial secretion.</p>

  <p>Now, the morbid poisons, if studied only in their results, shew that
  there is a combination of these two actions. There is usually, in the
  first place, a toxic or poisonous action, and secondly, a deteriorating
  or decomposing action on the blood, by which there is a tendency to low
  or asthenic inflammation and gangrene. It matters not what form of fever
  we take as an illustration, whether intermittent, pestilential, or
  exanthematous, either will serve the purpose of shewing how completely
  the effects of vegetable organic poisons resemble those which for the
  sake of distinction (I suppose) have been denominated Morbid Poisons.</p>

  <p>Take an attack from the paludal poison. It is <!-- Page 172 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page172"></a>{172}</span>usually ushered in with
  head-ache, weariness, pains in the limbs, and thirst, with other
  symptoms; all these are indicative of a poisonous agent in the blood:
  then come the full phenomena of the disease at a longer or shorter
  interval, and tending ultimately to destroy some organ of the body. The
  mind suffers during the course of the attack, and delirium occasionally
  happens. In severe cases of this disease, which were more frequent
  formerly than now, coma, delirium, and frenzy were observed at the
  commencement of the attack, and a tendency to rapid disorganization of
  one or several of the viscera.</p>

  <p>If we take the effects of poison of Erysipelas, of Scarlet Fever, or
  Plague, in each we find at the onset more or less general derangement of
  the system, usually with cerebral disturbance and disordered action of
  all the dynamic forces of the body, which clearly indicate the action of
  a poison; then, unless some favourable symptoms arise, the blood exhibits
  a steady advance towards disorganization, and sphacelation of one or more
  tissues or parts of the body ensues. In Erysipelas the force of the
  diseased action is expended on the skin, and subcutaneous cellular
  tissue; in Scarlet Fever the fauces ulcerate, and slough and the parotids
  suppurate; in the Plague there is a general tendency to putrefaction, and
  the formation of glandular abscesses with sphacelas. Without going any
  further into this matter, for my present intention is merely to draw <!--
  Page 173 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page173"></a>{173}</span>notice to certain facts, let me now ask,
  whether or not, do the poisons of the Ergot, the Uredo, and the Amanita,
  exhibit more analogy in their action on the nervous system, the blood and
  the tissues, than any other poisonous agents with which we are
  acquainted? If the whole range of the lower fungi could be examined in
  reference to their operation on the blood, as decomposers of organic
  compounds,&mdash;if experiments could be made, by which the properties of
  fungoid matter could be detected, I would venture to say the whole of the
  phenomena of these diseases could be readily comprehended and their
  intricacies unravelled.</p>

  <p>We know that the fungi are poisonous, that at times and seasons, and
  under variations of climate, they vary in their effects, and perhaps lose
  altogether these properties. We know that the fungi produce gangrene of
  the tissues, and disorganization of the blood; we know that their spores
  pervade the atmosphere, and are ready, under favouring conditions, to
  increase and multiply; we know that they are ubiquitous, and that those
  conditions most favourable to their development, are exactly such as are
  proved to foster and engender disease, and above all, they have been
  proved to be the elements of some diseases in man, in animals, and in
  plants. Can as much be said of any other known agents, animate or
  inanimate, comprised in our category?</p>

  <p>It has been said, we do not see after death,&mdash;the <!-- Page 174
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page174"></a>{174}</span>interlacing
  mycilium, or the sprouting pileus; therefore the fungi are not the agents
  of disease&mdash;it has been said that carbonic acid and alcohol are not
  found as products of diseased action&mdash;consequently disease is not a
  fermentative process. "In all cases," says Liebig, "where the strictest
  investigation has failed to demonstrate the presence of organic beings in
  the contagion of a miasm, or contagious disease, the hypothesis that such
  beings have cooperated, or do cooperate in the morbid process, must be
  rejected as totally void of foundation and support." Much as I admire the
  genius of this great man, it is difficult to refrain from remarking, that
  I doubt if any of his great discoveries would have been made, if, in the
  first instance, hypotheses had not formed the basis of all his
  researches. It has been said, "that casual conjunctions in chemistry,
  gave us most of our valuable discoveries:" and it is from casual
  conjunctions that hypotheses are usually formed, the working out proves
  either their fallacy or their truth, but to say that an hypothesis has no
  foundation, until demonstrated to be true, is rather knocking down
  argument. And who, let me ask, has been more prolific of hypotheses than
  our continental neighbour? Yet he, according to his mode of reasoning,
  would sweep away all such words from the vocabularies of philosophers.
  What foundation has the chemical hypothesis of disease, when it fails to
  explain the most important element <!-- Page 175 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page175"></a>{175}</span>of contagious and
  infectious diseases: viz. the reproductive property of their germs?</p>

  <p>It is perhaps necessary to say something in explanation of the sudden
  deaths arising from morbid poisons. They may occur from two causes. One
  being the result of a concentrated amount of poison germs being inhaled
  into the lungs, and acting as an ordinary toxic agent; and the other,
  which I put only hypothetically, the consequence of the rapid evolution
  of gas in the vessels arising from a sudden decomposition of blood, as it
  passes through the lungs. The only authority I have for this supposition,
  is the fact that the blood after death, from pestilential affections, is
  found to be far advanced towards decomposition; that in Paris last year,
  two patients were bled while suffering from Cholera, and with the small
  quantity of blood which flowed, bubbles of air also escaped:<a
  name="NtA70" href="#Nt70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> and besides this, it was
  demonstrated by Mr. Herapath, that ammonia was given off from Cholera
  patients, both by the lungs and skin. These facts, though they are not
  conclusive, nevertheless render it probable that such an explanation is
  not entirely out of reason&mdash;especially too, when we know how fatal
  are the effects of uncombined air, when it enters the vessels near to the
  heart.</p>

<p class="cenhead">SECTION III.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">WHAT RESULTS DO WE OBTAIN FROM THE EFFECTS OF REMEDIAL AGENTS, IN PROOF OF THE HYPOTHESIS?</span></p>

  <p>I have here used the word hypothesis, because, having so far advanced
  in the enquiry, I trust sufficient has been said to render the term
  applicable.</p>

  <p>Under the term remedial agents, I shall include all those causes,
  whether natural or artificial, which tend to neutralize or destroy the
  germs of infection, or miasmatic poison, whether this be effected out of
  or within the body.</p>

  <p>First, then, let us consider the results of drainage and cultivation
  in removing the causes of endemic disease. One well authenticated case is
  as good as a thousand. I will take one, which, from its source, will be
  received as unexceptionable; and from its association with a very learned
  and amusing book, will be accepted as an agreeable reminder of the many
  pleasant hours spent in the perusal of the poet Southey's "Doctor."</p>

  <p>"Doncaster is built upon a peninsula, or ridge of land, about a mile
  across, having a gentle slope from east to west, and bounded on the west
  by the river; this ridge is composed of three strata; to wit, of the
  alluvial soil deposited by the river in former <!-- Page 177 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page177"></a>{177}</span>ages, and of limestone
  on the north and west; and of sandstone to the south and east. To the
  south of this neck of land, lies a tract called Potteric Carr, which is
  much below the level of the river, and was a morass, or range of fens
  when our Doctor first took up his abode in Doncaster. This tract extends
  about four miles in length, and nearly three in breadth, and the security
  which it afforded against an attack on that side, while the river
  protected the peninsula by its semicircular bend on the other, was
  evidently one reason why the Romans fixed upon the site of Doncaster for
  a station. In Brockett's Glossary of North Country words, Carr is
  interpreted to mean 'flat marshy land,' 'a pool or lake;' but the
  etymology of the word is yet to be discovered.</p>

  <p>"These fens were drained and enclosed pursuant to an Act of
  Parliament, which was obtained for that purpose in the year 1766. Three
  principal drains were then cut, fourteen feet wide, and about four miles
  long, into which the water was conducted from every part of the Carr
  southward, to the little river Torne, at Rossington Bridge, whence it
  flows into the Trent. Before these drainings, the ground was liable to
  frequent inundations; and about the centre there was a decoy for wild
  ducks; there is still a deep water there of considerable extent, in which
  very large pike and eels are found. The soil, which was so boggy at first
  that horses were lost in attempting to drink at the drains, has been
  brought <!-- Page 178 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page178"></a>{178}</span>into good cultivation, (as all such ground
  may be) to the great improvement of the district; for till this
  improvement was effected, <i>intermittent fevers and sore throats were
  prevalent there, and they have ceased from the time the land was
  drained</i>. The most unhealthy season now, is the spring, when cold
  winds, from the north and north-east, usually prevail during some six
  weeks; at other times Doncaster is considered to be a healthy place. It
  has been observed that when endemic(?) diseases arrive there, they
  uniformly come from the south; and that the state of the weather may be
  foretold from a knowledge of what it has been at a given time in London,
  making an allowance of about three days, for the chance of winds. Here,
  as in all places which lie upon a great and frequented road, the
  transmission of disease has been greatly facilitated by the increase of
  travelling."</p>

  <p>I feel certain of being excused for transcribing this long passage
  from Southey. It would have been impossible to convey its whole meaning
  without giving it entire. The continuation of the chapter is no less
  instructive and applicable to our subject, though more particularly so to
  an extension of the enquiry. The sore throats and intermittents, from
  which Doncaster has been freed, by the drainage of Potteric Carr, informs
  us at once that decomposing matter is the material by which the poison of
  fever is vivified and sustained, the wet and boggy state of the soil is
  just the condition, when no drainage exists, to bring into activity the
  germs of <!-- Page 179 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page179"></a>{179}</span>disease, which otherwise would lie latent.
  So satisfied and acquainted are we with the elements necessary for the
  production of fever, that we might as certainly bring about an endemic
  intermittent by forming an artificial bog, as we could be sure of growing
  mushrooms by making a bed in the manner laid down by gardeners for this
  purpose. Dr. Lindley also says, "the <i>Polyporus fomentarius</i> has
  been artificially produced in Germany, but merely by placing wood in a
  favourable situation, and keeping it well moistened. Five or six crops
  were obtained in the year."</p>

  <p>Let warmth, moisture, darkness, and decaying matter be given, and
  inanimate disintegrated particles will soon be converted into definite
  forms and combinations instinct with life. It is by the unseen forms of
  living beings, that the atmosphere is preserved from becoming charged
  with deadly gases; they take the first rank in the great scheme of
  animated beings, the plant first, and then the animal. "Let the earth
  bring forth grass." "Let there be lights in the firmament." "Let the
  waters bring forth the moving creature, and fowl that may fly," and "Let
  the earth bring forth the cattle, the creeping thing, and the beast."
  This is the order of creation, of living things, and the earth was
  prepared by vegetation for the animal world. The work of conversion is
  accomplished by vegetation; and this is consumed for the construction of
  higher organizations.</p>

  <p>The laws which govern and control the universe, <!-- Page 180 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page180"></a>{180}</span>are as definite and as
  wonderful among invisible atoms, as those which regulate the enormous
  masses floating in space; and the time will come when the advancing
  intellect of man will measure and weigh the morbid poisons, as he
  measures and weighs the stars. Why should the laws of Epidemics be less
  understood, than the laws which govern the course of comets? The
  aspirations of man have led him to penetrate the heavens, which charm and
  inspire him; he studies rather the more violent disturbing elements of
  nature, the thunder-cloud and the fire of heaven, than the silent
  pestilence which steals over the earth. I cannot conceive it possible
  that the Intellects, which are occupied in procuring means for the
  Majesty of this empire to issue her mandates with the velocity of a
  spirit to the nethermost parts of the earth, should be incapable of
  solving so deeply interesting a mystery as the causes and nature of
  pestilential diseases. It would seem that man prefers to issue a mandate
  of destruction many thousand miles distant, than to disarm the pestilence
  at his door. It is barely a century since Galvani observed the twitchings
  in the muscles of a frog's leg, and the battery, still named after him,
  has already become an agent of instantaneous communication between places
  many miles distant. But how many centuries have passed away, each one
  succeeding the other, with its millions of victims to epidemics? And
  where are the remedies for the evils? Drainage and cleanliness, with all
  their advantages, were better understood and more fully carried out by
  the ancient <!-- Page 181 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page181"></a>{181}</span>Romans than by ourselves; there are
  monuments, though crumbling to decay, to tell us of the vast enterprise
  of these people and of the value they set upon a healthy and vigorous
  constitution, and how well they understood the means of warding of
  disease.</p>

  <p>Cultivation and drainage are now fully understood to be the basis by
  which a healthy condition of air is to be obtained, next to that,
  cleanliness and ventilation; if either be neglected a sickly, mouldy, and
  unwholesome contamination of atmosphere ensues; the odour of a bog is
  proverbially mouldy, and so is that of an ill-ventilated house or cellar;
  dryness, or the fresh pleasant scent of clean water, are the antagonists
  of these; the aromatic odours of vegetation are opponents of
  putrefaction, and consequently of the development of the lower forms of
  life. All empyreumatic matters prevent mouldiness and decomposition; and
  odours arrest and prevent the growth of mouldiness. The oil of birch,
  with which the Russia leather is impregnated, and which gives it so
  pleasant an odour, effectually prevents mouldiness, and consequently
  decay.</p>

  <p>Lindley says, "It is a most remarkable circumstance, and one which
  <i>deserves particular enquiry</i>, that the growth of the <i>minute
  fungi</i>, which constitute what is called mouldiness, is <i>effectually
  prevented</i> by any kind of perfume."<a name="NtA71"
  href="#Nt71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> Cedar has <!-- Page 182 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page182"></a>{182}</span>been used, from time
  immemorial, for a like purpose; and I doubt not the recommendation of
  Virgil, before quoted, in reference to the burning of cedar, was founded
  on some practical utility of this kind, though its <i>modus operandi</i>
  was unknown to him. Allied to these is a curious circumstance, and worthy
  attention. I copy the following from an old work on Pestilences. "It is
  remarkable that when the Plague raged in London, Bucklersbury, which
  stood in the very heart of the city, was free from that distemper; the
  reason given for it is, that it was chiefly inhabited by druggists and
  apothecaries, the scent of whose drugs kept away the infection, which
  were so unnatural to the pestilential insects, that they were killed or
  driven away by the strong smell of some sorts of them." "The smell of
  <i>rue</i>, and the smoke of tobacco, were prescribed as remedies against
  the infection; but especially tar and pitch barrels, which it was
  imagined preserved Limehouse, and some of the dock-yards from
  infection."<a name="NtA72" href="#Nt72"><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Pitch and tar dealers are everywhere spoken of as being remarkably
  exempt from infectious diseases.</p>

  <p>Cold infusion of tar was used in our colonies as a prophylactic
  against the Small Pox. Bishop <!-- Page 183 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page183"></a>{183}</span>Berkeley was induced to try it when this
  disease raged in his neighbourhood. The trial fully answered
  expectation&mdash;for all those who took tar-water, either escaped the
  disease, or had it very slightly.</p>

  <p>Tan yards and places in the immediate vicinity, are said to be free
  from pestilences. The tanners of Bermondsey are said to have escaped the
  Plague of London, and one person only died in Gutter Lane, where was a
  tan yard. The tanners of Rome are also stated to have been free from
  Plague. Dr. M&lsquo;Lean refers to the exemption of tanners at Cairo.
  <i>Tannin is prejudicial to most vegetables</i>,&mdash;but Dr. Lindley
  says it is not always so to fungi. "A species of Rhizomorpha is often
  developed in tan pits." I should imagine that neither plants nor insects
  would be found very abundantly, where tannin prevails; yet we find that
  the gall-nut is formed for the protection of an insect from injury by
  weather, and as a temporary means of sustenance.</p>

  <p>The custom of fumigating with odoriferous substances, does not
  therefore appear upon this view of the matter to be destitute of
  importance; indeed, the universal practice stamps it at once, as an
  efficacious remedy for the purposes of disinfection. The introduction of
  chlorine fumigation, seems to have superseded, in a great measure, the
  use of fragrant herbs and woods; and it is questionable whether the
  substitution be altogether desirable or <!-- Page 184 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page184"></a>{184}</span>advantageous. Many
  scents may be agreeably and usefully employed, with much less chance of
  annoyance to the patient, and considerably less injury to articles of
  furniture, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The fumigations of sulphurous acid and chlorine are, perhaps, more
  adapted as disinfectants in uninhabited apartments;&mdash;their power to
  destroy vegetation, is well known. They have been used, chiefly, with the
  idea of neutralizing gaseous exhalations, particularly chlorine, as it
  tends to combine with hydrogen, to form hydrochloric acid, and then to
  unite with ammoniacal matters, forming hydrochlorate of ammonia. This,
  supposing noxious or pestilential effluvia consisted of the ammoniacal
  exudations variously combined, was an exceedingly efficacious method of
  rendering them inert; but as we feel convinced that no ammoniacal
  compound could possibly be the cause of infection, we must look to the
  influence these gases possess over other forms of matter, and as they are
  so destructive, even in minute quantities, to vegetable existence, it is
  possible that their beneficial effects may be due to this property. The
  immediate neighbourhood of gas works is prejudicial to vegetation, I
  imagine, from the amount of sulphurous vapours, and to this has been
  attributed the exemption of persons employed in these works. Many other
  instances might be cited of a similar nature.</p>

  <p>I have now to speak of medicinal agents, and here comes a considerable
  difficulty. <!-- Page 185 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page185"></a>{185}</span></p>

  <p>If we might believe all that has been written on the sure and certain
  remedies for the "ills that man is heir to," we should be led to
  acknowledge that both nature and art were prodigal in antidotes and
  specifics. The all-bountiful hand of nature, I do not doubt, has at the
  same time scattered the seeds of good and of evil. The fertilizing
  showers fall to irrigate the soil, and produce food and nourishment to
  man; here and there is the reeking morass "feeding unnatural vegetation,"
  and if man takes up his abode in its vicinity, the rains which made it
  unhealthy, have also made it highly fertile; by labour and cultivation he
  may convert the mephitic bog into a waving corn-field, and the seeds of
  life and sustenance be made to supplant the seeds of death and
  corruption.</p>

  <p>It is generally believed, that where there are particular and specific
  diseases, there also may be found appropriate and specific remedies; the
  discoveries of chemistry, it is not improbable, may in some respects have
  retarded the progress of natural medicine. In the early ages of the
  world, the "healing plant" must have formed the staple of medical
  commerce, for though Tubal Cain<a name="NtA73"
  href="#Nt73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> has been considered as the first
  surgical instrument maker, because he was the first artificer in brass
  and iron, we have not discovered that chemical compounds entered into the
  composition of physic, till very <!-- Page 186 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page186"></a>{186}</span>many years after his
  time. To the alchemists we owe the science of chemistry, and much of the
  physic of the present day may be traced to them. The multiplicity of
  ingredients which at one time entered into the composition of one dose of
  physic could only be spoken of under the title of "legion." Who shall
  specify the active and curative ingredient (if there be one), when from
  five to a hundred may have been exhibited at the same time? It has been
  the pride of our physicians, that the pharmacop&oelig;ia has been
  simplified; it has not reached its most simple form yet. That many simple
  plants have specific and wonderful power over disease, is an indubitable
  fact, but I firmly believe that the laudable, though mistaken efforts of
  physicians to improve their effect by various combinations, have been the
  means of throwing many valuable medicines into oblivion; I must also add,
  that cheap physic and adulterations have had no small share too in the
  banishment of much valuable physic from ordinary practice. It has been
  believed, and I think with much reason, that a thorough search into the
  qualities of plants, would shew that "they are capable of affording not
  only great relief, but also effectual and specific remedies." "That they
  are not already found, is rather an argument that we have not been
  sufficiently inquisitive, than that there are no such plants endued with
  these virtues."</p>

  <p>Of the result obtained by medical treatment, in cases of epidemic or
  infectious disease, it is most <!-- Page 187 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page187"></a>{187}</span>difficult to speak, but as my province
  here is only to shew that living germs are the morbific agents, I have
  but to refer to such remedies as have been most extolled in controlling
  these affections. The disinfectants have already been mentioned in a
  cursory manner. An enumeration only of simple medicines used during the
  late Epidemic, shall conclude this work, as the treatment in former times
  could not by any possibility furnish satisfactory information. Aromatics
  and fragrant stimulants have in all times taken the foremost rank with
  acids, such as vinegar, lime and lemon juice. Mr. Guthrie's adoption of
  lemon juice in preference to bark, which he said made him worse while
  suffering from an attack of fever, during the Peninsular campaign, and
  his speedy recovery from the disease, though not from its effects, shews,
  when many others can bear equal testimony to its value, that such a
  remedy though simple is not to be despised.</p>

  <p>But to the late Epidemic. Dr. Stevens' saline treatment, appears, on
  the whole, to have been the most successful. Common salt was used both
  medically and dietetically, and formed the greatest bulk of the medicine
  employed. Chlorate of potash and carbonate of soda were added to the
  medicine.</p>

  <p>The nitro-hydrochloric acid was used with success at St. Thomas's
  Hospital.</p>

  <p>Dr. Copland used chlorate of potash, bicarb. soda, hydrochloric,
  ether, and camphor water.</p>

  <p>Dr. Ayre's calomel treatment had as many, if <!-- Page 188 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page188"></a>{188}</span>not more, opponents
  than advocates. Phosphorus had several advocates.</p>

  <p>Creasote and camphor were lauded by some. The beneficial operation of
  all these remedies might be explained on the theory here supposed, that
  living germs are the cause of Epidemic disease, but the specific action
  of any one remedy has not yet had sufficient attention or trial to enable
  me to make any deductions of a satisfactory or conclusive nature.</p>

  <p>In the uncertainty which generally prevailed as to the best method of
  treating Cholera patients, I was induced (for reasons stated in a
  pamphlet published last year) to try the efficacy of sulphur, which had
  been extolled as a specific. In its effects I was not disappointed; but
  as the results are already before the public, I need not do more than
  refer to it among other remedies.</p>

  <p>I did not contemplate even alluding to this subject, as it would
  extend far beyond my intended limits. This portion of the enquiry would
  be more properly carried out by keeping records of cases, treated in
  accordance with the view attempted to be established, and I have not the
  slightest hesitation in saying, that the most ample success would
  ultimately attend a well directed practice, based upon the principles
  inculcated in these pages.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>

  <p>In making the foregoing sketch, I have attempted to put together some
  ideas on a subject, which has for the last few years been a theme for
  meditation in leisure hours, viz. What are the causes of Epidemic,
  Endemic, and Infectious Diseases? The occurrence of Epidemic Cholera last
  year in this country, awakened a spirit of enquiry. Where there is
  unrest, whatever may be the cause, there also is disquiet and discontent.
  When the oracles of the age were consulted in the emergency, the
  discordant answers perplexed and confused the anxious searcher after
  truth. In the spring of last year, when the enemy was approaching, unseen
  and unheard, and the thousands of unconscious victims, who are now lying
  in their graves, were faithfully trusting and fully relying on the heads
  of our profession, and the resources of our art, what was the state of
  our defences, and what the nature or character of our resistance? One
  considerable body of men would discharge from a little tube of glass, a
  host of almost invisible globular atoms of sugar, said to be as potent
  and inscrutably operative as the unseen enemy. These infinitesimal
  practitioners assured the people that they "<i>had powerful means of
  subduing the disease</i>," <!-- Page 190 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page190"></a>{190}</span>but even they differed among themselves,
  though they carried out to the fullest extent the doctrine of their
  leader, <i>similia similibus</i>, which we may suppose to refer in this
  case to the minuteness of the opposing armamenta. Without, however,
  agreeing with this school, I may quote a passage from Dr. Curie, which
  is, alas! too true: "We have shewn, as they must (allopathists), and many
  of them do acknowledge, that they have no fixed basis, no natural law
  upon which their treatment rests."</p>

  <p>Who can deny the force of this observation? Sheltered by a principle,
  it matters not how fallacious, a man is placed as behind a barrier. If
  with any reason it could be shewn that the infinitesimal doses, could by
  no possibility effect a cure in Cholera; if it could be demonstrated by
  any line of argument, that a poison, a living poison, circulates with the
  blood, or lodges in the tissues, the homæopathist must fall; his
  "electricity and mineral magnetism," and "<i>powerful concentration of
  life power towards the digestive canal</i>," will stand for what they are
  worth. That minute doses of medicine can exert an active influence over
  the body is not to be denied, but these must consist of powerful drugs,
  as arnica, aconite, and nux vomica, with others, and it is more than
  probable, that of such medicines, an inconceivably small amount may
  produce a specific effect upon some portion of the organic nervous
  system.</p>

  <p>How is it that a dose of nitre or digitalis, "can <!-- Page 191
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page191"></a>{191}</span>convert
  cheerfulness into low spirits," or a grain of red sulphuret of antimony,
  "excite warmth and lively spirits?"<a name="NtA74"
  href="#Nt74"><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Why should indigo dyers become melancholy, and scarlet dyers
  choleric?<a name="NtA75" href="#Nt75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> We do not know.
  But there is one thing we most certainly do know, that a poison may be
  disarmed by an antidote, and the amount of the latter must be in
  proportion to that of the former, and as epidemic and contagious diseases
  do most unquestionably depend upon poisons of a specific nature, and of
  great amount and activity, an infinitesimal remedy, however it may claim
  to direct and control the organic forces, under slight and ordinary
  disturbances, can be no more effectual in destroying the poison of fever,
  or small pox, than in neutralizing arsenic or prussic acid.</p>

  <p>The uncertainty which generally prevails as to the treatment of
  Epidemic diseases, Fevers, &amp;c. induced me to put together the notions
  which are contained in these pages, in the hope of leading to some
  definite ideas of the causes of these affections, and consequently to a
  more uniform and scientific mode of treating them.</p>

  <p>I have endeavoured to shew that reproduction is a phenomenon
  inseparable from morbific matter, and that in all probability the
  vegetable kingdom is the source of the germs.</p>

<p><!-- Page 192 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192"></a>{192}</span></p>

  <p>The train of argument adopted is such as appeared to me most natural
  for such an enquiry, and it rests now only with those who are capable of
  deciding whether such a course, though (I am sensibly aware) not without
  many faults in conception and execution, is calculated to advance the
  science of medicine and the interests of mankind.</p>

  <p>The real tree of knowledge, possesses in the spongioles of its roots,
  an elective property, by which truth alone can enter; nourished and
  sustained by this, it sends a fragrant incense and breathing odour on
  high, and dispels the mists of ignorance and superstition. In natural
  causes and reasonable deductions we must seek for instruction and solid
  information, for in over-straining either nature or art, deformity and
  error must inevitably be the result.</p>

  <p>"If we examine the Cow Pox and the Small Pox microscopically, as I
  have done very carefully in every stage, we find that the essential
  character consists of a number of minute cells, not exceeding the
  10,000th part of an inch in diameter, being about one-fourth smaller than
  the globules of the blood, containing <i>within their circumference many
  still more minute nuclei, and presenting</i> beyond their circumference
  bud-like cells of the same size and character as those contained within
  the circle. They exactly resemble in everything except the size, the

  subcuticular tissue, where, after a few days if they find their
  appropriate nutrient elements, they grow and multiply."</p>

  <p>"J. S. Michael Leger, published at Vienna, in 1775, a treatise

  beyond the era of the Trojan war, 1212, A. C.</p>

  <p>The Chinese pretend to discriminate no less than 40 different species
  of Small Pox.</p>

  <p>"They also pretend to discover whether a person has died by violence
  or from natural causes, not only after the body has been some time

  after the total disappearance of the soft parts, and when the dry
  skeleton alone is left."&mdash;For the process, see <i>Hamilton's History

  <p>To give some notion of the state of Medical Science among the Chinese,
  I may quote the following: "The theory of the circulation of the blood,
  Du Halde affirms, was known by the Chinese about 400 years after the

  the present day, do the nation possess of the circulating system of the
  human frame."&mdash;<i>China and the Chinese, Henry Charles Sirr, M.

  <p>"Of an unaccountable vapour suddenly coming, I have this relation from
  Richard Humphrey, my neighbour, and a man of veracity, that on Wednesday,
  April 27, 1727, as he and one Walter, were travelling a-foot from
  Canterbury; when they came to Rainham, they were assaulted with such a
  strong loathsome stink, as he thought was like the stench from a
  corrupted human corpse. They were so offended at it, as thinking it was
  from carrion in that town, that they would not stay there to rest and
  refresh themselves, but travelled on for about two hours, mostly in the

  Prichard states that vast forests are destroyed either for the purpose of
  tillage or accidentally by conflagrations. "The same trees do not
  reappear in the same spots, but they have successors, which seem
  regularly to take their place. Thus the pine forests of North America

  <p><a name="Nt43" href="#NtA43">[43]</a> "The metamorphosis of starch

  <p><a name="Nt44" href="#NtA44">[44]</a> As regards starch there appears
  to be some peculiar faculty regarding it. It is converted into sugar
  during the ripening of fruit, and it is just possible that being as it is
